To demonstrate the use of linear regression we examine a dataset that illustrates the relationship between Height and Weight in a group of 237 teen-aged boys and girls. The dataset is available [here](https://github.com/PSIAIMS/CAMIS/blob/3dca6398dca4f242eb0f0c316d7499eaba8adb13/data/htwt.csv) and is imported to the workspace.

### Descriptive Statistics

The first step is to obtain the simple descriptive statistics for the numeric variables of htwt data, and one-way frequencies for categorical variables. This is accomplished by employing summary function. There are 237 participants who are from 13.9 to 25 years old. It is a cross-sectional study, with each participant having one observation. We can use this data set to examine the relationship of participants' height to their age and sex.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Importing CSV
htwt = pd.read_csv("../data/htwt.csv")
```

In order to create a regression model to demonstrate the relationship between age and height for females, we first need to create a flag variable identifying females and an interaction variable between age and female gender flag.

```{python}
htwt['female'] = (htwt['SEX'] == 'f').astype(int)
htwt['fem_age'] = htwt['AGE'] * htwt['female']
htwt.head()
```

### Regression Analysis

Next, we fit a regression model, representing the relationships between gender, age, height and the interaction variable created in the datastep above. We again use a where statement to restrict the analysis to those who are less than or equal to 19 years old. We use the clb option to get a 95% confidence interval for each of the parameters in the model. The model that we are fitting is ***height = b0 + b1 x female + b2 x age + b3 x fem_age + e***

```{python}
X = htwt[['female', 'AGE', 'fem_age']][htwt['AGE'] <= 19]
X = sm.add_constant(X)
Y = htwt['HEIGHT'][htwt['AGE'] <= 19]

model = sm.OLS(Y, X).fit()

model.summary()
```

From the coefficients table b0,b1,b2,b3 are estimated as b0=28.88 b1=13.61 b2=2.03 b3=-0.92942

The resulting regression model for height, age and gender based on the available data is ***height=28.8828 + 13.6123 x female + 2.0313 x age -0.9294 x fem_age***
