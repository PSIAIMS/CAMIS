# Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test

The CMH procedure tests for conditional independence in partial contingency tables for a 2 x 2 x K design. However, it can be generalized to tables of X x Y x K dimensions.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('../images/cmh/img.png')
```

## Naming Convention

For the remainder of this document, we adopt the following naming convention when referring to variables of a contingency table:

-   X = exposure

-   Y = response

-   K = control

## Scale

The `scale` of the exposure (X) and response (Y) variables dictate which test statistic is computed for the contingency table. Each test statistic is evaluated on different degrees of freedom (df):

-   `General association` statistic (X and Y both nominal) results in `(X-1) * (Y-1) dfs`

-   `Row mean` scores statistic (X is nominal and Y is ordinal) results in `X-1 dfs`

-   `Nonzero correlation` statistic (X and Y both ordinal) results in `1 df`

# Testing Strategy

## Data

To begin investigating the differences in the SAS and R implementations of the CMH test, we decided to use the CDISC Pilot data set, which is publicly available on the PHUSE Test Data Factory repository. We applied very basic filtering conditions upfront (see below) and this data set served as the basis of the examples to follow.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Download CDISC Pilot Dataset
# Perform filtering
library(haven)
data <- read_xpt("https://github.com/phuse-org/TestDataFactory/raw/main/Updated/TDF_ADaM/adcibc.xpt") |> 
  filter(EFFFL == 'Y' & ITTFL == 'Y', AVISITN == 8 & ANL01FL=='Y') 
head(data)

```

## Schemes

In order to follow a systematic approach to testing, and to cover variations in the CMH test, we considered the traditional 2 x 2 x K design as well as scenarios where the generalized CMH test is employed (e.g. 5 x 3 x 3).

We present 5 archetype test scenarios that illustrate diverging results, possibly related to sparse data and possibly considered edge cases.

| Number | Schema | Variables                      | Relevant Test       | Description                                                                                                                      |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1      | 2x2x2  | X = TRTP, Y = SEX, K = AGEGR1  | General Association | TRTP and AGEGR1 were limited to two categories, overall the the groups were rather balanced                                      |
| 3      | 2x2x3  | X = TRTP, Y = SEX, K = RACE    | General Association | Gives back NaN in R because RACE is very imbalanced                                                                              |
| 6      | 2x5x2  | X = TRTP, Y = AVAL, K = SEX    | Row Means           | Compare Row Means results for R and SAS because Y is ordinal                                                                     |
| 9      | 3x5x17 | X = TRTP, Y = AVAL, K = SITEID | Row Means           | SITEID has many strata and provokes sparse groups, AVAL is ordinal, therefore row means statistic applies here, R threw an error |
| 10     | 5x3x3  | X = AVAL, Y = AGEGR1, K = TRTP | Correlation         | X and Y are ordinal variables and therefore the correlation statistics has to be taken here                                      |

# Results

scenarios this is a test

As it can be seen, there are two schemata where R does not provide any results:

```{r, echo = FALSE}

  arrange(Scenario) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = lang, values_from = c("Chisq", "Df", "Prob")) |>

    groupname_col = "Scenario"
  ) |> 
  tab_spanner(
    label = "Chi-Square",
    columns = starts_with("Chisq")
  ) |> 
  tab_spanner(
    label = "df",
    columns = starts_with("Df")
  ) |> 
  tab_spanner(
    label = "p-value",
    columns = starts_with("Prob")

  cols_label(
    Chisq_SAS = "SAS",
    Chisq_R = "R",
    Df_SAS = "SAS",
    Df_R = "R", 
    Prob_SAS = "SAS",
    Prob_R = "R"
  ) |>
  tab_options(row_group.as_column = TRUE) |>
  tab_footnote(
    footnote = md("**Reason for NaN in schema 3**: Stratum k = AMERICAN INDIAN OR ALASKA NATIVE can not be compared because there are only values for one treatment and one gender."),
    cells_row_groups(groups = "3"),
    placement = "right"
  ) |> 
  tab_footnote(
    footnote = md("**Reason for Error 4:**

```

# Summary and Recommendation

Having explored the available R packages to calculate the CMH statistics, using R can only be recommended if the analysis design is equivalent to 2 x 2 x K. Then, the base mantelhaen.test() function as well as the vcdExtra package show reliable results which are equal to the output of the SAS function. The same is true for the common odds ratio even though there is a marked difference in decimals.

For the generalized version of the cmh test no R package can be recommended so far. SAS and R outputs differ substantially (possibly due to the underlying subroutines or functions) and the vcdExtra package seems to deliver inconsistent results outside the 2 x 2 x K design.
