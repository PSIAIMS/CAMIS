# Summary

## Goal

Comparison of results between SAS vs R for different applications of logistic regression; where possible we try to ensure the same statistical method or algorithm is specified. However, there are some underlying differences between the algorithms in SAS vs R that cannot be (at least not easily) "tweaked". The document also provides some remarks on what parameters to look out for and what could have caused the numerical differences.

### Firth logistic regression

Exact match cannot be obtained for all estimates using `logistf` vs `PROC LOGISTIC` procedure (with Firth option). More specifically:\
- Coefficient estimate and 95% CI matched at 0.001 level;\
- Standard error are not the same (e.g., 0.02023 for age in R vs 0.02065 in SAS);\
- p-value is not the same (0.6288 in R for age vs 0.6348 in SAS);\

### g-computation with covariate adjustment

Exact match (at 0.001 level) can be obtained using `get_marginal_effect` in R vs `%margins` macro in SAS.

In the following sections, the parameterisation of logistic regression implementation (with an without Firth option) will be compared followed by numerical comparison using example data.

# Prerequisites

## R packages

```{r, output = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(survival) # for example data
library(logistf) # for firth regression
library(beeca) # for covariate adjustment
```

## Data

### Logistic regressions

We use the `lung` dataset provided with {survival} R package. Initial data preparation involves generating a new binary outcome based on the weight change.

```{r}
# the lung dataset is available in ./data/lung_cancer.csv
lung2 <- survival::lung %>% 
  mutate(
    wt_grp = factor(wt.loss > 0, labels = c("weight loss", "weight gain"))
  ) 
glimpse(lung2)
```

### g-computation

We use the `trial01` dataset provided with {beeca} R package. Initial data preparation involves setting the treatment indicator as a categorical variable and removing any incomplete cases.

```{r}
data("trial01")

trial01$trtp <- factor(trial01$trtp) ## set treatment to a factor

trial01 <- trial01 %>% filter(!is.na(aval)) ## remove missing data i.e complete cases analysis
# save the dataset to be imported in SAS
# write.csv(trial01, file = "data/trial01.csv", na = ".")
```

## Numerical Comparison {#sec-num-comp}

Every effort is made to ensure that the R code employs estimation methods/ optimization algorithms/ other components that closely match (as much as possible) those used in the SAS code. 

### `glm` in R

Note, the default fitting method in `glm` is consistent with the default fitting method in `PROC LOGISTIC` procedure.

-   Default fitting method in `glm` is iteratively reweighted least squares, and the documentation can be found [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/glm).
-   Default fitting method for `PROC LOGISTIC` procedure is Fisher's scoring method, which is reported as part of the SAS default output, and it is equivalent to "Iteratively reweighted least squares" method as reported in this [documentation](https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63347/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_logistic_sect033.htm).

```{r}
# stats::glm function
m1 <- glm(wt_grp ~ age + sex + ph.ecog + meal.cal, data = lung2, family = binomial(link="logit"))
# model coefficients summary
summary(m1)$coefficients
```
Note, function `confint.default` gives the Wald confidence limits, which is the default option in SAS `PROC LOGISTIC` procedure; whereas `confint` gives the profile-likelihood limits. Conditional odds ratio is calculated by taking the exponential of the model parameters.

```{r}
cbind(est = coef(m1), 
          confint.default(m1))
```
### `PROC LOGISTIC` in SAS (without firth option)

```{sas, eval = FALSE}
PROC LOGISTIC DATA=LUNG2; # import lung
	MODEL WT_GRP(EVENT="weight_gain") = AGE SEX PH_ECOG MEAL_CAL;
	ods output ESTIMATEs=estimates;
run;
```

### Comment on model selection

As indicated in [Logistic regression in R](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/R/logistic_regr.html) and [Logistic regression in SAS](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/SAS/logistic-regr.html), the chi-Sq test statistics and p-values are different when performing model selections in R vs. SAS. The reason for this discrepancy is that the chi-Sq statistics from `anova()` in R is based on deviance test using residual deviance while the chi-Sq statistics from `PROC LOGISTIC` w/ `SELECTION` option in SAS is based on Wald test using z-values squared.

### Conclusion for logistic regression

Exact match (at 0.001 level) can be obtained using `glm` in R vs `PROC LOGISTIC` procedure (without Firth option) in SAS, for coefficient estimates, 95% CI, and for p-value.

: Firth's Bias-Reduced Logistic Regression in SAS vs R {#tbl-2}

## Numerical Comparison

Note that while Firth logistic regression is not required for our example dataset nonetheless we use it for demonstration purposes only.

### `logistf` in R

-   By default, the [convergence criteria in `logistf`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/logistf/logistf.pdf) specifies that three criteria need to be met at the same time, i.e., the change in log likelihood is less than lconv (default is 1E-5), the maximum absolute element of the score vector is less than gconv (default is 1E-5), and the maximum absolute change in beta is less than xconv (default is 1E-5). In SAS, the [default convergence criteria in `PROC LOGISTIC`](https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63962/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_logistic_sect034.htm) specifies relative gradient convergence criterion (GCONV=1E--8); while SAS also support three other convergence criteria but when there are more than one convergence criterion specified, the optimization is terminated as soon as one of the criteria is satisfied. By looking at the R pacakge/SAS documentation, the `gconv` criteria in `logistif` function is different from the `GCONV` in SAS. The `lconv` criteria is also not exactly the same as the `ABSFCONV` or `FCONV` in PROC LOGISTIC in SAS, although the criteria use log likelihood. However, similar convergence criteria might be obtained by using the maximum absolute change in parameter estimates (i.e., `xconv` in R and SAS). Therefore, for comparison with the SAS output, in `logistf` function, we use a large convergence criteria value for `lconv` and `gconv` to mimic the scenario where only `xconv` is checked, i.e., specify `logistf.control(xconv = 0.00000001, gconv = 1, lconv = 1)` for the `control` argument.

-   By default, `logistf` function in R computes the confidence interval estimates and hypothesis tests (including p-value) for each parameter based on profile likelihood, which is also reported in the output below. However, Wald method (confidence interval and tests) can be specified by specifying the `control` argument with [`pl = FALSE`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/logistf/logistf.pdf).

```{r}
firth_mod <- logistf(wt_grp ~ age + sex + ph.ecog + meal.cal,
                     data=lung2, 
                     control = logistf.control(fit ="IRLS", 
                                               xconv = 0.00000001, 
                                               gconv = 1, 
                                               lconv = 1))
summary(firth_mod)$coefficients

## Code below would give Wald CI and tests results by adding `pl = FALSE`
# logistf(..., pl = FALSE)
```

Note, function `confint` gives the profile-likelihood limits. Given the parameters from Firth's bias-reduced logistic regression is estimated using penalized maximum likelihood, `confint` function is used. Conditional odds ratio is calculated by taking the exponential of the model parameters.

```{r}
cbind(est = coef(firth_mod), 
          confint(firth_mod))
```

### `PROC LOGISTIC` in SAS (with firth option)

-   Note, by default, SAS computes confidence interval based on Wald tests. Given the parameters from Firth's method is estimated using penalized maximum likelihood, below specifies CLODDS = PL CLPARM=PL (based on profile likelihood), which is consistent with the maximization method and the R code above. However, the [default hypothesis test for the regression coefficients](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/9.4_3.4/statug/statug_logistic_details50.htm) is still a Wald test, and the Chi-square statistics is calculated based on coefficient estimate and its corresponding standard error.

-   `XCONV` specifies relative parameter convergence criterion, which should correspond to the `xconv` in `logistf` function in R. We specify `XCONV = 0.00000001` so it should be consistent with the R code above.

```{sas, eval = FALSE}
PROC LOGISTIC DATA=LUNG2;
	MODEL WT_GRP(EVENT="weight gain") = AGE SEX PH_ECOG MEAL_CAL / firth clodds=PL clparm=PL xconv = 0.00000001;
	ods output ESTIMATEs=estimates;
run;
```

### Conclusion for Firth logistic regression

Exact match cannot be obtained for all estimates using `logistf` vs `PROC LOGISTIC` procedure with Firth option. More specifically:\
- Coefficient estimate and its 95% CI matched at 0.001 level;\
- Standard error are not the same (e.g., 0.02023 for age in R vs 0.02065 in SAS);\
- p-value is not the same (0.6288 in R for age vs 0.6348 in SAS);\

# g-computation with covariate adjustment

We compare two implementions of g-computation in SAS:

1.  The "Predictive margins and average marginal effects" [%margins](https://support.sas.com/kb/63/038.html#pur) macro. The %margins macro uses "the delta method \[...\] to determine the standard errors for predictive margins and marginal effects". Note that the %margins macro uses the `PROC GENMOD` procedure to implement the working logistic regression model and require another macro [%NLEST](https://support.sas.com/kb/58/775.html) to calculate contrasts that requires delta methodl such as risk ratio or odds ratio.
2.  The SAS code provided in the appendix of the [Ge et al. (2011)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/009286151104500409) implements the method outlined in the associated paper and simulations. Note: the Ge et al. (2011) macro uses the `PROC LOGISTIC` procedure to implement the working logistic regression model. `PROC IML` is used to calculate the delta method to determine the standard errors.

## Numerical Comparison

### `get_marginal_effect` in R

We fit a logistic regression model with covariate adjustment to estimate the marginal treatment effect using the delta method for variance estimation: as outlined in Ge et al (2011).

```{r glm}
## fit the model including model based variance estimation with delta method
fit1 <-
  glm(aval ~ trtp + bl_cov, family = "binomial", data = trial01) %>% 
  get_marginal_effect(
    trt = "trtp",
    method = "Ge",
    contrast = "diff",
    reference = "0",
    type = "model-based"
  )
cat("Marginal treatment effect = ", fit1$marginal_est, "\n",
    "Standard error = ", fit1$marginal_se, "\n"
    )
```

### `%Margins` macro in SAS

We now use the SAS [`%Margins`] (https://support.sas.com/kb/63/038.html) macro to perform the Ge et al. (2011) method on `trial01` to estimate the marginal risk difference and it's standard error.

```{r engine='sas', eval=FALSE}
%Margins(data      = myWork.trial01,
         class     = trtp,
         classgref = first, /*Set reference to first level*/
         response  = avaln,
         roptions  = event='1', /*Ensure event is set to 1 = Yes */
         dist      = binomial,  
         model     = trtp bl_cov,
         margins   = trtp, 
         options   = cl diff reverse, /*Specify risk difference contrast and 
                                      direction of treatment effect is correct*/
         link      = logit);  /*Specify logit link function */
	
** Store output data sets ; 
data myWork.margins_trt_estimates;
  set work._MARGINS;
run;
         
data myWork.margins_trt_diffs;
  set work._DIFFSPM;
run;
```

![](../images/logistic_regression/sas_logistic_gcomp_margins.png){fig-align="left"}

### `%LR` macro in SAS (Ge et al, 2011)

```{r engine='sas', eval=FALSE}
%LR(data = myWork.trial01, /* input data set */
	var1 = bl_cov, /* continuous covariates in the logistic regression */
	var2 = trtp, /* categorical covariates in the logistic regression */
	p1 = 1, /* number of continuous covariates in the logistic regression */
	p2 = 1, /* number of categorical covariates in the logistic regression */
	resp = avaln, /* binary response variable in the logistic regression */
	ntrt = 1); /* position of the treatment variable in the categorical covariates */
	
data myWork.ge_macro_trt_diffs;
  set work.geout;
run;
```

# Final remarks

In summary, there are a few things to be aware of when comparing logistic regression results in R vs SAS. It is crucial to carefully manage the input parameters for each model to ensure they are configured similarly for logistic regression analyses. As highlighted also in [Logistic Regression in SAS](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/SAS/logistic-regr.html), the variable parameterization is also important for modelling and interpretation, ensuring the types of variable (continuous vs. categorical) and reference values of categorical variable are applied as expected. 

1.  **Likelihood optimization method**

-   The default likelihood optimization method in `glm` and `PROC LOGISTIC` is the same (i.e., Fisher's scoring method or iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS)).

-   However, the default optimization method in `logistf` is Newton-Raphson, which can be modified into IRLS via `control = logistf.control(fit = “IRLS”)`. Alternatively, one could specify `technique = newton` in the model statement in SAS to modify the likelihood optimization method.

2.  **Convergence criteria**

-   Although both SAS and R allows options to modify the convergence criteria, the criteria does not seem to be exactly the same, which could cause results mismatch in some scenarios.

-   The [default convergence criteria in `PROC LOGISTIC`](https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63962/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_logistic_sect034.htm) specifies the relative gradient convergence criterion; where the [default convergence criteria in `glm`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/glm.control.html) specifies relative difference between deviance.

-   The default setting in logistf have checked more than one convergence criterion in its algorithm (i.e., [change in log likelihood, derivative of the log likelihood and parameter estimates](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/logistf/logistf.pdf)). One could specify a very large value for two of the criteria in order to mimic the scenario where only one criterion is checked (e.g., `control = logistf.control (xconv = 0.00000001, lconv = 1, gconv = 1`) in `logistf` in R should be consistent to the option of `xconv = 0.00000001` in SAS).

3.  **Confidence interval**

-   The `confint()` function in R will computes profile likelihood based CI for `glm` fitted model. However, in SAS, the default confidence interval is Wald CI. To match the default CI calculation in SAS for `glm` fitted model, use `confint.default()` function in R.

-   Nevertheless, Firth's biased-reduced logistic regression estimates parameter using penalized maximum likelihood, it makes more sense to use `confint()` function for `logistf` fitted model. In the meantime, in SAS, when fitting a Firth's logistic regression, it is also better to specify the model statement option `clparm = pl` which will also generate profile penalized likelihood CI.

-   We shall note that in the Firth logistic regression numerical example, the estimated standard errors does not match, but the CIs match at 0.001 level. This is because the CI was estimated based on profile penalized likelihood in R and SAS, and please see the next discussion point for potential reasons about differences between the estimated standard error. (I have compared Wald CIs estimated in R vs SAS, which could not match. This make sense as Wald CIs are calculated based on the estimated standard errors.)

4.  **Hypothesis test and p-value**

-   The default hypothesis tests for the regression coefficients are the same in `glm` and `PROC LOGISTIC`, which are both Wald tests and calculated based on estimates for the regression coefficients and its corresponding standard error.

-   As for `logistf` function, the default hypothesis testing method is based on profile penalized log likelihood (source code [here](https://github.com/georgheinze/logistf/blob/master/R/logistf.R)). And it was noted in the [R documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/logistf/logistf.pdf) that, *"from version 1.24.1 on, the variance-covariance matrix is based on the second derivative of the likelihood of the augmented data rather than the original data, which proved to be a better approximation if the user chooses to set a higher value for the penalty strength."* This could cause difference in the estimate of standard error in R vs SAS for Firth logistic regression, and consequently results in differences in the corresponding Wald CI estimates and hypothesis tests results (e.g., p-values).

-   Wald method can be used in a `logistf` function in R by specifying `pl = FALSE` in the `control` argument, which should correspond to the method used in SAS to calculate p-value. However, when specifying `pl = FALSE`, the CI is also calculated using Wald method.
