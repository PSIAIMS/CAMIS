### Negative binomial regression

Exact match (at 0.001 level) can be obtained using `glm.nb` in R vs `PROC GENMOD` procedure in SAS, for parameter and lsmeans estimates, confidence intervals and p-values after manually adjusting the estimated variance-covariance matrix in R. For the dispersion parameter the MLEs also match, however discrepancies in the confidence intervals are observed.
:::

In the following sections the implementations will be compared in tabular fashion followed by a numerical comparison using dummy data.

# Comparison of key features of SAS and R implementations

The following set of tables compare the two implementations and which options need to be adjusted in R to obtain matching results if necessary. The following aspects are compared:

1.  Parameterization of the negative binomial distribution
2.  Likelihood optimization algorithm
3.  Estimation of the variance-covariance matrix
4.  Convergence criteria
5.  Confidence interval (CI) estimation method
6.  Hypothesis tests for regression coefficients
7.  Estimation of marginal means

## How to read the tables:

Let's walk through the conclusions for [Table 1](#tbl-1):

-   SAS and R use different parameterizations of the negative binomial
-   SAS and R use different likelihood optimization algorithms
-   There are differences in the estimation of the variance-covariance matrix, in particular the covariance between dispersion/scale parameter and model coefficients. It is however possible to obtain the SAS variance-covariance matrix in R.
-   Convergence criteria are not generally identical in SAS and R.
-   CI estimation methods are by default not identical but by using alternative confint function in R SAS method can be reproduced\
-   Methods for hypothesis testing for model coefficients are equivalent in SAS and R.
-   Least-square or marginal means are not directly available in R but equivalent estimation as in SAS is possible with additional packages

: Negative binomial regression in SAS vs R {#tbl-1}

# Numerical Comparison {#sec-num-comp}

-   SAS `PROC GENMOD` procedure

-   R `MASS::glm.nb`

A dummy dataset is first generated, and negative binomial regression is applied to the dummy dataset for demonstration purposes. Every effort is made to ensure that the R code employs estimation methods/ optimization algorithms/ other components that closely match (as much as possible) those used in the SAS code. This is done to facilitate a comparison of estimates, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values between the two implementations.

## Prerequisites: R packages

In order to run these analyses we need to load a few packages.

```{r}
#| output: false
#| message: false
library(MASS)
library(dplyr)
library(emmeans)
```

We also define the `glm_nb_cov` function to obtain the SAS variance-covariance matrix in R from [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/221648/negative-binomial-regression-in-r-allowing-for-correlation-between-dispersion).

```{r}
#| output: false
#| message: false
## Helper function to compute the variance from negative binomial regression
## This matches with variance estimated from SAS
glm_nb_cov <- function(mod) {
  # given a model fitted by glm.nb in MASS, this function returns a variance covariance matrix for the
  # regression coefficients and dispersion parameter, without assuming independence between these
  # note that the model must have been fitted with x=TRUE argument so that design matrix is available
  
  # formulae based on p23-p24 of

  # and http://www.math.mcgill.ca/~dstephens/523/Papers/Lawless-1987-CJS.pdf
  
  # lintr: off
  # please rm -- variable not used!
  # k <- mod$theta
  # lintr: on
  # p is number of regression coefficients
  p <- dim(vcov(mod))[1]
  
  # construct observed information matrix
  obsInfo <- array(0, dim = c(p + 1, p + 1))
  
  # first calculate top left part for regression coefficients
  for (i in 1:p) {
    for (j in 1:p) {
      obsInfo[i, j] <- sum((1 + mod$y / mod$theta) * mod$fitted.values * mod$x[, i] * mod$x[, j] /
                             (1 + mod$fitted.values / mod$theta)^2)
    }
  }
  
  # information for dispersion parameter
  obsInfo[(p + 1), (p + 1)] <- -sum(trigamma(mod$theta + mod$y) - trigamma(mod$theta) -
                                      1 / (mod$fitted.values + mod$theta) + (mod$theta + mod$y) / (mod$theta + mod$fitted.values)^2 -
                                      1 / (mod$fitted.values + mod$theta) + 1 / mod$theta)
  
  # covariance between regression coefficients and dispersion
  for (i in 1:p) {
    obsInfo[(p + 1), i] <- -sum(((mod$y - mod$fitted.values) * mod$fitted.values /
                                   ((mod$theta + mod$fitted.values)^2)) * mod$x[, i])
    obsInfo[i, (p + 1)] <- obsInfo[(p + 1), i]
  }
  
  # return variance covariance matrix
  solve(obsInfo, tol = 1e-20)
}
```

## Dummy data

A dummy dataset is simulated, including

-   100 subjects;
-   $grp$: a dummy variable with 1:1 subject assignment to treatment ($grp = 1$) vs placebo ($grp = 0$); note, variable $grpc$ is a character version of $grp$, which takes the value of "Trt" or "Plb".
-   $x1$: a continuous variable which follows a normal distribution of mean of 0 and sd of 1;
-   $x2$: a categorical variable which take the value of "A" or "B" or "C" with a probability of 0.3, 0.2, 0.5, respectively.
-   $logtime$: An offset for the calculation of rates (e.g time in years) on the log-scale
-   $y$: a negative binomial outcome giving the event counts;

The dummy dataset is saved as a csv file, and then the csv file is read into SAS.

```{r}
N = 100

# set seed for replication
set.seed(123)

# Treatment Group; 1:1 ratio
grp <- rep(c(0,1),each= N/2)

# Covariates (one continuous; one categorical)
x1 <- rnorm(N)
x2 <- factor(sample(LETTERS[1:3], N, replace = TRUE, 
                    prob=c(0.3, 0.2, 0.5)))

# Offset
logtime <- log(runif(N, 1, 2))

# Model parameter assumption
beta0 = 0.6
betaTrt = -0.5
beta1 = 0.25
beta2 = c(-0.1, 0.2)
theta = 1/2


# Dummy dataset
df <- data.frame(grp,x1, x2, logtime) %>% 
   mutate(log_rate = 
            case_when(x2 == "A" ~ beta0 + betaTrt*grp + beta1*x1 + logtime,
                      x2 == "B" ~ beta0 + betaTrt*grp + beta1*x1 + beta2[1] + logtime, 
                      x2 == "C" ~ beta0 + betaTrt*grp + beta1*x1 + beta2[2] + logtime),
          y = rnegbin(N, mu = exp(log_rate), theta = theta),
          grpc = factor(case_when(grp==0 ~"Plb",
                                 grp==1 ~"Trt")))

# save the dummy dataset to be imported in SAS
# write.csv(df, file = "df_dummy_negbin.csv")
```

## Negative binomial regression

### Conclusion for negative binomial regression

Exact match (at 0.001 level) can be obtained using `glm.nb` in R vs `PROC GENMOD` procedure in SAS, for parameters and lsmeans estimates, confidence intervals and p-values after manually adjusting the estimated variance-covariance matrix in R. For the dispersion parameter the MLEs also match, however discrepancies in the confidence intervals are observed.
:::

### Negative binomial regression in SAS

After importing the dummy dataset we can run the negative binomial regression in SAS using \`PROC GENMOD. We estimate the model parameters and lsmeans for the treatment arms using both the default and OM weights.

```{sas}
*| eval: false;
proc genmod data=df;
	class GRPC (ref='Plb') X2 (ref='A');
	model y = GRPC x1 x2 / dist=negbin link=log offset=logtime;
	lsmeans GRPC /cl;
	lsmeans GRPC /cl OM;
run;
```

Below is a screenshot of output tables summarizing coefficient estimates and lsmeans.

![](../images/negbin/sas_negbin_estimates.jpg){fig-align="left"}

## Negative binomial regression in R

Lets now try to reproduce the results in R using `MASS::glm.nb`.

```{r}
fit <- glm.nb(y ~ grpc + x1 + x2 + offset(logtime), data = df, x = TRUE)

# model coefficients summary
summary(fit)$coefficients
```

We can see that while the estimates are exactly matching those in SAS, the standard errors are slightly smaller. This is a result of the difference in covariance estimation mentioned above. To obtain exactly the same results as in SAS we need to re-estimate the covariance matrix using the `glm_nb_cov` function we defined earlier. Note that to use this function with the fitted results we needed to specify `x = TRUE` in the `glm.nb` function so that the design matrix is available.

```{r}
sigma_hat <- glm_nb_cov(fit)

## recalculate confidence intervals, and p-values
coef_est <- coef(fit)
coef_se <- sqrt(diag(sigma_hat)[1:5])
coef_lower <- coef_est - qnorm(0.975) * coef_se
coef_upper <- coef_est + qnorm(0.975) * coef_se
zstat <- coef_est/coef_se
pval <- 2 * (1-pnorm(abs(zstat)))
new_summary <- cbind(coef_est, coef_se, coef_lower, coef_upper, zstat, pval)
colnames(new_summary) <- c("Estimate", "Std. Error", "CI_lower", "CI_upper", "z value", "Pr(>|z|)")
rownames(new_summary) <- rownames(summary(fit)$coefficients)
new_summary
```

Now the estimates, standard errors, 95% confidence interval limits and p-values are exactly matching those in SAS up to the 4th digit. We can also provide an estimate and CI for the dispersion parameter:

```{r}
# estimate and 95%-CI for k = 1/theta
theta_est <- fit$theta
theta_se <- sqrt(sigma_hat[6, 6])
theta_est_ci <- c(theta_est, theta_est - qnorm(0.975) * theta_se, theta_est + qnorm(0.975) * theta_se)
1/theta_est_ci[c(1, 3, 2)]
```

We see that while the point estimate is the same as in SAS, the CI for the dispersion does not match, most likely due to the different parameterizations used by SAS and R.

Finally we can replicate the estimation of lsmeans in SAS via the emmeans package. Note that we need to supply the re-estimated covariance matrix, but only provide the rows and columns for the model coefficients without the dispersion parameter as emmeans does not need the latter.

```{r}
# lsmeans with weights = equal, equivalent to SAS default
lsmean1 <- emmeans(fit, ~ grpc, data=df, vcov. = sigma_hat[1:5, 1:5], weights = "equal", offset = 0)
lsmean1
# lsmeans with weights = proportional, equivalent to SAS OM option
lsmean2 <- emmeans(fit, ~ grpc, data=df, vcov. = sigma_hat[1:5, 1:5], weights = "proportional", offset = 0)
lsmean2
```

Estimates and CIs are exactly matching those in SAS for both of the options. Finally we can also obtain the z statistic and corresponding p-values:

```{r}
test(lsmean1)
test(lsmean2)
```

And we see that these are also identical to the SAS results.

## Discussion

As shown above it is generally possible to obtain exactly matching results in SAS and R for negative binomial regression. Most important to ensure matching is the manual estimation of the covariance matrix in R, as otherwise standard errors will only asymptotically match those in SAS.

As shown above lsmeans-type estimates can also be exactly reproduced using the emmeans package in R if options are correctly specified.

For the dispersion parameter an exact match in the MLE is possible, however CIs were not matching in our example. Most likely this is due to the different parameterizations used in SAS and R, since the variance for the dispersion parameters can not be transformed exactly between the two parameterizations. As generally the dispersion parameter should be of lesser interest and the other parameter estimates are not affected by this, this may however not be an issue in most applications.

Even though results matched in the numerical example we have also highlighted that there are differences in the implementations, in particular when it comes to maximum likelihood optimization methods and convergence criteria. It is possible that this may lead to different estimates for data where the MLE is not easy to find and the methods may disagree on convergence or the optima of the likelihood. In addition, the different parameterizations may lead to different results in scenarios, where there is only very little overdispersion, since in those cases the dispersion parameter will go towards zero in SAS and towards infinity in R.

As a final point it should be kept in mind when comparing SAS and R results, that the two apply different rules for rounding. R rounds to the even digit (i.e. both 1.5 and 2.5 round to 2), while SAS uses "conventional" rounding rules (i.e 1.5 is rounded to 2 and 2.5 to 3). This can also occasionally lead to differences in results and may need to be addressed by using a custom rounding function in R, that uses SAS rounding rules. An example of such a function is provided in one of the references given below.
