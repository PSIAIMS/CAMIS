Results from the examples shown for R [here](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/R/survival.html) and SAS [here](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/SAS/survival.html) were compared below.

Comparing the non-stratified model results side-by-side, the CIs for the quartile estimates and landmark estimates are different between R and SAS. HR and CI also have slight differences.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}
library(tibble)
knitr::include_graphics("../images/survival/r_sas_default.png")   
```

## Reason 1: Cox Regression Handling of Tied Survival Times

The default methods for handling ties in a Cox regression model are different which can lead to a different result for the Hazard ratio and associated confidence interval.

R uses "efron" by default. SAS uses "breslow" by default. Both R and SAS are able to change these default options. By making the changes to the code below, we can force R to use "breslow" to match SAS, or SAS to use "efron" to match R. When the software use the same methods, then we obtain an identical HR and CI.

-   R: change method for ties to use "breslow"

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fit.cox <- coxph(Surv(LENFOLY, FSTAT) ~ AFB, ties = "breslow", data = dat)
```

-   SAS: change method for ties to use "efron"

```{r, eval=FALSE}
proc phreg data=dat;
class afb;
model lenfol*fstat(0) = afb/rl ties = efron;
run;
```

If there are no tied event times, then the methods are equivalent.

The Breslow approximation is the easiest to program and hence it historically became the first option coded for almost all software. It then ended up as the default option when other options were added in order to maintain "backwards compatibility". The Efron option is more accurate if there are a large number of ties, and it was therefore selected as the default option in R. In practice the number of ties is usually small, in which case all the methods are statistically indistinguishable.

From the arguments of `coxph` in R, there are three possible choices for handling tied event times 'ties=breslow', 'ties=efron', or 'ties='clogit'. This last option is an exact partial likelihood approach. See \[here\](

coxph function - RDocumentation) for more detail.

## Reason 2: Kaplan Meier Median Survival Confidence Intervals

The default methods for calculation of the confidence interval of a KM estimator are different in the two languages (for example, for calculation of the CI associated with the Median Survival estimate, the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile).

R uses "log" by default, and SAS uses "log-log" by default. As shown below, using 'conf.type' option, R can be forced to use the "log-log" method to match SAS. Alternatively, using the 'conftype=' option, SAS can be forced to use the "log" method to match R.

-   R: change to "log-log"

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fit.km <- survfit(Surv(LENFOLY, FSTAT) ~ AFB, conf.type = "log-log", data = dat)
```

-   SAS: change to "log"

```{r, eval=FALSE}
proc lifetest data=dat conftype=log;
time lenfoly*fstat(0);
strata afb;
run;
```

"log-log" prevents the problem of having confidence intervals of \>1 or \<0, which might happen if using "log" transformation. However, both R and SAS will clip the interval at \[0, 1\] and report a bound \>1 as 1 and \<0 as 0.

From a [reference](https://myweb.uiowa.edu/pbreheny/7210/f15/notes/9-10.pdf): The appeal of the log-log interval is clear, but the log-scale interval has the advantage of variance stabilization. As a result, simulation studies have generally found it to have better (closer to nominal) coverage; for this reason, it is the default in the `survival` package.

Now if we change the confidence interval type in SAS to "log" and tie handling to "efron", the results will be identical to the results in R.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/survival/r_sas_chg_default.png")   
```

Below is the side-by-side comparison for stratified analysis with default methods in SAS matched to R's, the results are also identical.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/survival/r_sas_stratified.png")   
```

# Other Cases Where Discrepancies Are Found

Now we look at other cases when the data has some special type which causes a mismatch between SAS and R. Suppose a dataset has 10 observations, and the first 5 are all events, and the last 5 are all censored.

```{r}
test <- tibble(time = c(54, 75, 77, 84, 87, 92, 103, 105, 112, 118), 
                   status = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0))

test
```

## Differences Observed in the KM Estimators

Suppose we are interested to know the 25%, 50% and 75% quartile estimates, and the day 80, 100, and 120 estimates.

Below is the R code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fit.km <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, conf.type = "log-log", data = test)
## quantile estimates
quantile(fit.km, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
## landmark estimates at 80, 100, 120-day
summary(fit.km, times = c(80, 100, 120), extend = T)
```

Below is the SAS code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
proc lifetest data=dat outsurv=_SurvEst timelist= 80 100 120 reduceout stderr; 
time lenfoly*fstat(0);
run;
```

Below is the side-by-side comparison:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/survival/r_sas_special.png")   
```

## Reasons

The reasons for the differences are because:

**Reason 1: Survival estimate does not cross the 50% percentile.**

The kth quantile for a survival curve S(t) is the location at which a horizontal line at height p= 1-k intersects the plot of S(t) as shown in the KM curve below. Since S(t) is a step function, it is possible for the curve to have a horizontal segment at exactly 1-k, in which case the midpoint of the horizontal segment is returned.

For example, using the data above, the survival probability is exactly 0.5 at time=87 and remains at 0.5 until the last censored observation at 118.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/survival/other_diff_km.png")   
```

When using R, the median is the smallest time which survival estimate is \<= 0.5 --\> `(87+118) / 2 = 102.5.` However, SAS searches the smallest time which survival estimate is \< 0.5, which does not exist in this dataset, so it gives "NE" (Not evaluable).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pl <- survminer::ggsurvplot(fit.km, 
                            conf.int = TRUE,
                            ggtheme = theme_light()) 
pl$plot +  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, color = "black", linetype = "solid")  

summary(fit.km)
```

**Reason 2: Last event censored and prior to the required landmark estimate.**

For the 120-day event-free estimate, SAS considers that 120 days is beyond the maximum observed day in the data (which was a censored event at time =118). Therefore, SAS considers this as Unknown and returns a result of "NE" (Not-evaluable). However, R uses the rate at last observed censored date to estimate the 120-day event free rate. As the event-free estimate at time of the last censored event at 118 was 0.5 (0.184, 0.753), R makes the assumption that this is the best estimate for the event-free rate at Time =120.

If we change the last observation in the dataset to be an event (instead of censored), R and SAS will both give 0 for the event-free survival estimate, because it is for sure that all subjects did not survive beyond 120 days.

```{r}
test <- tibble(time = c(54, 75, 77, 84, 87, 92, 103, 105, 112, 118), 
                   status = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1))

test
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/survival/r_sas_special_lst.png")   
```
