## Kruskal-Wallis: R and SAS

From the individual R and SAS pages, performing the Kruskal-Wallis test in R using:

```{r}
#| eval: false
kruskal.test(Sepal_Width~Species, data=iris_sub)
```

and in SAS using:

```{r}
#| eval: false
proc npar1way data=iris_sub wilcoxon;
class Species;
var Sepal_Width;
exact;
run;
```

produced the same results for the test statistic and asymptotic p-value.

There is a difference between languages in that SAS provides the EXACT option to easily output the exact p-value, where R does not seem to have an equivalent. A Monte Carlo permutation test may offer an alternative to the exact test on R. The `coin` package could help in implementing this.
