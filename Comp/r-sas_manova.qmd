title: "Multivariate Analysis of Variance in R vs SAS"

**MANOVA: Testing for group mean vectors are the same vs at least one is different**

When applying the following hypothesis, SAS and R match identically see [R](../R/manova.qmd) and [SAS](../SAS/manova.qmd).

-   **H0**: Group mean vectors are the same for all groups or they don't differ significantly.

-   **H1**: At least one of the group mean vectors is different from the rest.

However, if interest was in comparing 1 level of a parameter vs the others, this was only achieved using SAS. Contrast statements in SAS were easy to implement as shown here [SAS](..SAS/manova.qmd) however R did not replicate these results and to date a solution has not been found.

NOTE: if you feel you can help with the above discrepancy please contribute to the CAMIS repo by following the instructions on the [contributions page](../contribution.qmd).
