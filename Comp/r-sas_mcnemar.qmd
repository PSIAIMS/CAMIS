title: "R v SAS McNemar's test"
---

## Introduction

McNemar's test is a test of marginal homogeneity. That is used with 2x2 contingency tables, when both x and y are binary factors.

## General Comparison Table

The following table provides an overview of the support and results comparability between R and SAS for the new analysis point.

| Analysis | Supported in R | Supported in SAS | Results Match | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| McNemar's Chi-Squared test | [Yes](../R/mcnemar.qmd) | [Yes](../SAS/mcnemar.qmd) | ✅ | By default SAS doesn't include the continuity correction. |
| Cohen's Kappa CI | [Yes](../R/mcnemar.qmd) | [Yes](../SAS/mcnemar.qmd) | ✅ |  |

In R,the {stats} or the {coin} package can be used to calculate McNemar. The {coin} package has the same defaults as SAS. But, using either of these packages, the first step is to calculate a frequency table, using the table function.

```{r}
library(coin)
colds <- 
  read.csv(
    file = "../data/colds.csv")
freq_tbl <- table("age12" = colds$age12, "age14" = colds$age14)
freq_tbl
coin::mh_test(freq_tbl)

```

In order to get Cohen's Kappa an additional package is needed.

```{r}
library(vcd)
cohen_kappa <- Kappa(freq_tbl)
cohen_kappa
confint(cohen_kappa, level = 0.95)
```

The FREQ procedure can be used in SAS with the AGREE option to run the McNemar test, with OR, and RISKDIFF options stated for production of odds ratios and risk difference. These options were added as `epibasix::mcNemar` outputs the odds ratio and risk difference with confidence limits as default. In contrast to R, SAS outputs the Kappa coefficients with confident limits as default.

``` sas
proc freq data=colds;
    tables age12*age14 / agree or riskdiff;
run;
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/mcnemar/sas-mcnemar.png")
```

## Summary and Recommendation
When calculating the odds ratio and risk difference confidence limits, SAS is not treating the data as matched-pairs. There is advice on the SAS blog and SAS support page to amend this, which requires a lot of additional coding.

{stats} is using Edward's continuity correction by default, but this can be removed. In contrast, there is no option to include Edward's continuity correction in SAS, but this can be manually coded to agree with R. However, its use is controversial due to being seen as overly conservative.

There is another R package that is sometimes used to calculate McNemar's, called `epibasix`. This package is no longer being maintained, and there was no documentation available for certain methods used. Therefore, the use of the `epibasix` package is advised against and other packages may be more suitable.
