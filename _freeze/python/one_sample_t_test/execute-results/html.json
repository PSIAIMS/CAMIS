In the One Sample t-test, the mean of the sample is compared against the hypothesis value. In Python, a One Sample t-test can be performed using the scipy.stats.ttest_1samp(...) function from the scipy package, which accepts the following parameters:\n\n1.*a*: Sample observations.\n\n2.*popmean*: Expected value in null hypothesis. If array_like, then its length along axis must equal 1, and it must otherwise be broadcastable with a.\n\n3.*nan_policy*: Defines how to handle input NaNs.\n\n4.*alternative* (optional): Defines the alternative hypothesis.\n\n5.*keepdims*: If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.\n\n## Data Used\n\n::: {#6e08b9b6 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create sample data\ndata = {\n    'score': [40, 47, 52, 26, 19, 25, 35, 39, 26, 48, 14, 22, 42, 34, 33, 18, 15, 29, 41, 44, 51, 43, 27, 46, 28, 49, 31, 28, 54, 45],\n    'count': [2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe following code was used to test the comparison in Python.
