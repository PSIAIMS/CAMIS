The function has the argument `type` which allows for nine different percentile definitions to be used. The default is `type = 7`, which uses a piecewise-linear estimate of the cumulative distribution function to find percentiles.\n\nThis is how the 25th and 40th percentiles of `aval` could be calculated using the default `type`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nquantile(aval, probs = c(0.25, 0.4))\n```\n:::\n",
