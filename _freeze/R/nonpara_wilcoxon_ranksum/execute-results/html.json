The aim is to compare two independent groups of observations. Under certain scenarios, it can be thought of as a test for median differences, however this is only valid when: 1) both samples are independent and identically distributed (same dispersion, same shape, not necessarily normal) and 2) are symmetric around their medians.\n\nGenerally, with two samples of observations (A and B), the test uses the mean of each possible pair of observations in each group (including the pair of each value with itself) to test if the probability that (A\\>B) \\> probability (B\\>A).\n\nThe Wilcoxon rank sum test is often presented alongside a Hodges-Lehmann estimate of the pseudo-median (the median of the Walsh averages), and an associated confidence interval for the pseudo-median.\n\nA tie in the data exists when an observation in group A, has the same result as an observation in group B.\n\n## Useful References\n\n-   [Methods and Formulae](https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab/help-and-how-to/statistics/nonparametrics/how-to/1-sample-wilcoxon/methods-and-formulas/methods-and-formulas)\n-   [Mann Whitney is not about medians in general](https://github.com/adrianolszewski/Mann-Whitney-is-not-about-medians-in-general)\n-   [Relationship between walsh averages and WRS](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/215889/prove-the-relationship-between-walsh-averages-and-wilcoxon-signed-rank-test)\n-   [Hodges Lehmann Problems](https://aakinshin.net/posts/r-hodges-lehmann-problems)\n\n## Available R packages\n\nThere are three main implementations of the Wilcoxon rank sum test in R.\n\n-   [stats::wilcox.test](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/wilcox.test)\n\n-   [asht::wmwTest()](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/asht/asht.pdf)\n\n-   [coin::wilcox_test()](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/coin/coin.pdf)\n\nThe `stats` package implements various classic statistical tests, including Wilcoxon rank sum test. Although this is arguably the most commonly applied package, this one does not account for any ties in the data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# x, y are two unpaired vectors.
