Here we will cover one of the most common {rpact}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(rpact)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# **Two Sample Non-inferiority test: Comparing means for parallel design (unpaired)**\n\nThis example is a sample size calculation for the following hypotheses: $H_0:\\mu2-\\mu1\\le -\\theta$ versus $H_1: \\mu2-\\mu1\\gt -\\theta$.\n\nA client is interested in conducting a clinical trial to compare two cholesterol lowering agents for treatment of hypercholesterolemic patients through a parallel design. The primary efficacy parameter is a low-density lipidprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We will consider the situation where the intended trial is for testing noninferiority. For establishing it, suppose the true mean difference is 0 and the noninferiority margin is chosen to be -0.05 (-5%). Assuming SD = 0.1, how many patients are required for an 80% power and an overall significance level of 5%?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngetDesignInverseNormal(kMax = 1, alpha = 0.05) |>\n    getSampleSizeMeans(thetaH0 = -0.05, \n                       alternative = 0,\n        stDev = 0.1,\n        allocationRatioPlanned = 1) |>\n    summary() \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n*Sample size calculation for a continuous endpoint*\n\nFixed sample analysis, one-sided significance level 5%, power 80%.\nThe results were calculated for a two-sample t-test, H0: mu(1) - mu(2) = -0.05, \nH1: effect = 0, standard deviation = 0.1.\n\n| Stage                             |  Fixed |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| Stage level (one-sided)           | 0.0500 |\n| Efficacy boundary (z-value scale) |  1.645 |\n| Efficacy boundary (t)             | -0.017 |\n| Number of subjects                |  100.3 |\n\nLegend:\n\n* *(t)*: treatment effect scale\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHere the recommended sample size is 100.3, so we will need to round up to 51 subjects per arm. \n\n\n\n\n",
