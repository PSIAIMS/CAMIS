Further we also present the estimate of $\\sigma$. All numbers are rounded to 4 digits\n\n| Statistic          | censReg()  | survreg() | vglm() | LIFEREG | Match | Notes |\n|--------------------|------------|-----------|--------|---------|-------|-------|\n| Treatment effect   | 1.8225          | 1.8225          | 1.8226          | 1.8225          | Yes | see below\n| Standard error     | 0.8061          | 0.8061          | 0.7942          | 0.8061          | Yes | see below\n| p-value            | 0.0238          | 0.0238          | 0.0217          | 0.0238          | Yes | see below\n| 95% CI (Wald based)| 0.2427 ; 3.4024 | 0.2427 ; 3.4024 | 0.2661 ; 3.3791 | 0.2427 ; 3.4024 | Yes | see below\n| $\\sigma$           | 1.7316          | 1.7316          | 1.7317          | 1.7316          | Yes | see below\n\n\nNote: The results of `VGAM::vglm()` are slightly different since an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm is used for estimation.\n\n### Note: one-sided p-values\nUsing SAS `PROC LIFEREG`, one-sided p-values can be easily obtained by adding `UPPER` (in the presented data example this corresponds with $H_1: \\mu_B>\\mu_A$) or `LOWER` (this corresponds with $H_1: \\mu_B<\\mu_A$) in the `estimate` statement. In the presented data example, the obtained p-values are:\n\n- `UPPER`: $p_{one-sided} = 0.0119$\n\n- `LOWER`: $p_{one-sided} = 0.9881$\n\nUsing R, no option is available with `censReg::censReg` or `survival::survreg` to directly obtain the one-sided p-values. However, the one-sided p-values can be easily calculated. For example, for a right one-sided p-value (in the presented data example this corresponds with $H_1: \\mu_B>\\mu_A$) the following rules need to be followed:\n\n- If the estimate $\\mu_B - \\mu_A \\geq 0$, then $p_{one-sided} = p_{two-sided}/2$\n\n- If the estimate $\\mu_B - \\mu_A < 0$, then $p_{one-sided} = 1 - (p_{two-sided}/2)$\n\nFor a left one-sided p-value this should be done the other way around. Applying this rule to the results obtained in R, gives similar one-sided p-values as SAS for the presented data example.\n\n\n# Summary and Recommendation\n\nComparison between SAS `PROC LIFEREG` and R functions `censReg::censReg` and `survival::survreg` show identical results for the dataset tried. \n\nHistorically and typically the Tobit model is based on the assumption of normal distributed data. Within SAS `PROC LIFEREG` and R `survival::survreg` multiple other different distributional assumption are possible. These include *weibull*, *exponential*, *gaussian*, *logistic*, *lognormal* and *loglogistic* for `survival::survreg`. These include *EXPONENTIAL*, *GAMMA*, *LLOGISTIC*, *LOGISTIC*, *LOGNORMAL*, *NORMAL*, *WEIBULL* for `PROC LIFEREG`.\n\n# References\n\nBreen, R. (1996). Regression models.
