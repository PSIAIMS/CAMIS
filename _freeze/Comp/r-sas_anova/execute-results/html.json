In SAS, all contrasts must be manually defined, whereas in R, we have many ways to use pre-existing contrast definitions.   The `emmeans` package makes simplifies this process, and provides syntax that is similar to the syntax of SAS.\n\nThis is how we would define a contrast in SAS.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# In SAS\nproc glm data=work.mycsv;\n   class drug;\n   model post = drug pre / solution;\n   estimate 'C vs A'  drug -1  1 0;\n   estimate 'E vs CA' drug -1 -1 2;\nrun;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nAnd this is how we would define the same contrast in R, using the `emmeans` package.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm(formula = post ~ pre + drug, data = df_trial) %>% \n  emmeans(\"drug\") %>% \n  contrast(method = list(\n    \"C vs A\"  = c(-1,  1, 0),\n    \"E vs CA\" = c(-1, -1, 2)\n  ))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNote, however, that there are some cases where the scale of the parameter estimates between SAS and R is off, though the test statistics and p-values are identical.  In these cases, we can adjust the SAS code to include a divisor.  As far as we can tell, this difference only occurs when using the predefined Base R contrast methods like `contr.helmert`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproc glm data=work.mycsv;\n   class drug;\n   model post = drug pre / solution;\n   estimate 'C vs A'  drug -1  1 0 / divisor = 2;\n   estimate 'E vs CA' drug -1 -1 2 / divisor = 6;\nrun;\n```\n:::\n",
