The following holds for data that are assumed to be normally distributed. In this comparison, we used the [rbmi](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rbmi/index.html) package in R and the so-called [Five macros](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres-projects-groups/missing-data#dia-missing-data) in SAS.\n\nThe following assumptions are made in both languages:\n\n-   Equal unstructured covariance matrix across treatment groups\n\n-   Same covariates formula for the imputation and analysis model\n\n-   Similar number of MCMC tuning parameters (burn-in, thinning) was used in the MCMC\n\n-   The one intermittent missingness was imputed under MAR assumption\n\n| Analysis | Supported in R | Supported in SAS | Results Match | Notes |\n|--------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n| rbmi - MI MAR | [Yes](../R/rbmi_continuous_joint.html) | [Yes](../SAS/rbmi_continuous_joint_SAS.html) | Yes | Results will be (slightly) different given the randomness in multiple imputations |\n| rbmi - MI MNAR Copy Reference | [Yes](../R/rbmi_continuous_joint.html) | [Yes](../SAS/rbmi_continuous_joint_SAS.html) | Yes | Results will be (slightly) different given the randomness in multiple imputations |\n| rbmi - MI MNAR Jump to Reference | [Yes](../R/rbmi_continuous_joint.html) | [Yes](../SAS/rbmi_continuous_joint_SAS.html) | Yes | Results will be (slightly) different given the randomness in multiple imputations |\n| rbmi - MI MNAR Copy Increments in Reference | [Yes](../R/rbmi_continuous_joint.html) | [Yes](../SAS/rbmi_continuous_joint_SAS.html) | Yes | Results will be (slightly) different given the randomness in multiple imputations |\n\n## Comparison Results\n\nThe following figure compares the contrast estimate (and associated 95% confidence interval) for the explored dataset per number of multiple imputations *M* (ie, 500, 2000 and 5000). Note that the complete case analysis is presented across *M* for completeness. For the contrast estimate the range of the difference between R and SAS results are \\[-0.29 to 2.21\\]%, \\[0.0 to 0.75\\]% and \\[-0.25 to 0.19\\]% for respectively M=500, 2000, 5000.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/rbmi/COMP_fig1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nCC = Complete Case; MAR = Missing at Random; MNAR = Missing not at Random, CIR = Copy Increments in Reference; CR = Copy Reference; JR = Jump to Reference\n\n# Summary and Recommendation\n\nThe computational time for M=500 was similar between the `rbmi` package and the `Five macros` with 26 and 23 seconds. However, for M=2000 the `Five macros` (44 seconds) was approximately double as fast than the `rbmi` package (92 seconds).",
