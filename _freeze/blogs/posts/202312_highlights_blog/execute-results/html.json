This searchable repository compares analysis method implementations in software (CAMIS) such as SAS, R and python.\n\nThe [white paper](https://phuse.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Deliverables/Data+Visualisation+%26+Open+Source+Technology/WP077.pdf), Key Considerations When Understanding Differences in Statistical Methodology Implementations Across Programming Languages -- An Introduction to the CAMIS Project was published in June, which highlighted the importance of clearly specifying your analysis, such that it can be replicated in different software and doesn't rely on default options, which can be different.\n\nFor more complex analyses, it can still be hard to understand what defaults and algorithms your software is using, so the team focused 2023 on expanding our github [repo](repo) content, comparing SAS vs R methods. By August, we had covered the following topics in the repo: quartiles, rounding, ANOVA, MMRM, the CMH test, log-rank, Cox PH, the McNemar test, the Kruskal-Wallis test and logistic. October saw the launch of the CAMIS-Oncology sub-group, led by Somasekhar Sriadibhatla (AstraZeneca). This team will focus specifically on oncology endpoints and analysing them in SAS, R and Python.\n\nThe CAMIS team have expanded in membership this year and presented at conferences around the world. In November, we welcomed Harshal Khanolkar (Novo Nordisk) to join the leadership team alongside Christina Fillmore (GSK) and Lyn Taylor (Parexel). Our focus for 2024 will be on creating additional content for the repo and sharing awareness of the project across the medical research and wider community.\n\nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our team members and contributors, and encourage everyone to check out the repository and help us grow our content. If you would like to join the team, please get in touch through the github repo.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/202312 highlights.jpg){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n",
