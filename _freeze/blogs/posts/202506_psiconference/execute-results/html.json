PHUSE kindly supported the team with provision of PHUSE CAMIS t-shirts and stickers to hand out, which contained the QR code for the repo. This really helped us to stand out among the 400+ statisticians and to spread the word about the CAMIS project repository.\n\nThe first of the talks entitled: \"R you (all) right, SAS? Replicating statistical results between software\", contained an introduction to the CAMIS project presented by Lyn Taylor, followed by a case study example on how to compare methods across software and in particular methods to assess which r packages to use, presented by Christina Fillmore. Slides can be found here: [CAMIS](../../non_website_content/conferences/2025/202506_PSI_Christina_Lyn.pptx)\n\nIn the second talk entitled: (Sample) size matters - demonstrating sample size calculations across software, Agnieszka Tomczyk presented findings from replicating sample size methods in SAS, StatXact, EAST and R. Slides can be found here: [Samplesize](../../non_website_content/conferences/2025/202506_PSI_Agnieszka_Tomczyk.pptx)\n\nWe received really positive feedback from the industry on our CAMIS repository, with everyone agreeing it will help to eliminate duplication of researching the methodology differences between software.\n\nPlease help to promote CAMIS by sharing the sticker below !\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/2025stickers.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n",
