See ^2^ for explanation of non-inferiority and how to perform Sample size in SAS (including comparing proportions). Below we give 2 sample size examples for the following types of studies:\n\n-   two-sample comparison of means for Non-inferiority (i.e. testing if one treatment mean is non-inferior to the another treatment mean).\n\n-   Paired-sample comparison of means (i.e. 2 treatment means recorded on 1 group of patients are equivalent within a set tolerance)\n\n# **Two Sample Non-inferiority test: Comparing means for parallel design (unpaired)**\n\nThis example is a sample size calculation for the following hypotheses: $H_0:\\mu2-\\mu1\\le -\\theta$ versus $H_1: \\mu2-\\mu1\\gt -\\theta$.\n\nA client is interested in conducting a clinical trial to compare two cholesterol lowering agents for treatment of hypercholesterolemic patients through a parallel design. The primary efficacy parameter is a low-density lipidprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We will consider the situation where the intended trial is for testing noninferiority. For establishing it, suppose the true mean difference is 0 and the noninferiority margin is chosen to be -0.05 (-5%). Assuming SD = 0.1, how many patients are required for an 80% power and an overall significance level of 5%?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.sas .cell-code}\nPROC POWER;    \n    twosamplemeans \n    test=equiv_diff      \n    lower  = 91\n    upper  = 101  \n    meandiff=96 \n    stddev = 8\n    ntotal = .  \n    power  = 0.8\n    alpha  = 0.05;\nRUN;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nAs shown below, a total sample size of 102 is recommended, which equates to 51 in each group.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/sample_s_noninferiority/2_sample_parallelgroup_means.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# **Comparing means for crossover design (paired)**\n\nHere we assume there is no carry-over effect and that the variance is known. For more information see^3^. There is no obvious way in SAS to do cross over non-inferiority, however, given the one sided test, you can half the alpha using the equiv_diff option to give you the non-inferiority sample size.\n\n## **Estimating the within patient variance and correlation.**\n\nLet's consider a standard two-sequence, two period crossover design. Suppose that the sponsor is interested in showing non-inferiority of the test drug against the reference with the non-inferiority margin -20%. Assume power of 80%. Based on the results from previous trials, it is estimated that the variance (of the difference) is 0.2 (20%). Suppose that the true mean difference is -0.1 (-10%). What is the required sample size, assuming significance level of 5%?\n\nAlpha = 0.025 is used below, instead of 0.05 because you are doing non-inferiority (a one sided test). Note that this is still the sample size for alpha=0.05. The below shows a sample size of 13 patients is required.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.sas .cell-code}\npairedmeans \ntest=equiv_diff\n    lower = -0.3\n    upper = 0.1\n    meandiff = -0.1\n    stddev = 0.2\n    corr = 0.5\n    alpha = 0.025\n    npairs = .\n    power = 0.8;\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/sample_s_noninferiority/2_sample_crossover_means.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### References\n\n1.
