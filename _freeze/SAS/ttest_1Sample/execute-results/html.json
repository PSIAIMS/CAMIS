The one sample t-test compares the mean of the sample to a provided null hypothesis, called \"h0\". The h0 value is provided as an option. By default, the h0 value is zero (0). Running the procedure produces a set of results that suggest whether or not the null hypothesis should be rejected.\n\n### Data Used\n\nThe following data was used in this example.\n\n```         \n  data read;\n     input score count @@;\n     datalines;\n  40 2   47 2   52 2   26 1   19 2\n  25 2   35 4   39 1   26 1   48 1\n  14 2   22 1   42 1   34 2   33 2\n  18 1   15 1   29 1   41 2   44 1\n  51 1   43 1   27 2   46 2   28 1\n  49 1   31 1   28 1   54 1   45 1\n  ;\n```\n\n## Normal Data {#normal}\n\nBy default, SAS PROC TTEST t-test assumes normality in the data and uses a classic Student's t-test.\n\n### Code\n\nThe following code was used to test the comparison of a reading scores against a baseline hypothesis value of 30:\n\n```         \n  proc ttest data=read h0=30;\n     var score;\n  run;\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/ttest/onesample_test1.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Lognormal Data {#lognormal}\n\nThe SAS one sample t-test also supports lognormal analysis for a one sample t-test.\n\n### Code\n\nUsing the same data as above, we will set the \"DIST\" option to \"lognormal\" to perform this analysis:\n\n```         \n  proc ttest data=read h0=30 dist=lognormal;\n     var score;\n  run;\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/ttest/onesample_test2.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAs can be seen in the figure above, the lognormal variation of the one sample TTEST provides results for geometric mean, coefficient of variation, and 95% confidence limits for the coefficient of variation.\n",
