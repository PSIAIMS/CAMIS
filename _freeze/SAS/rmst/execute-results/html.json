If you follow this guidance, then you must ensure that you use:\n\n`model time*status(0)` as the model to ensure SAS knows that 0 is the censored observation.\n\nThis is a little confusing, because firstly the information in brackets is asking for what is the indicator of censored observations, which is contrary to the name of the variable being 'status' !\n\nIn other survival procedures, we often have a variable `cnsr` which we set to 1=censored or 0=event, and hence we use `model time*cnsr(1)`. We find this more straight forward that using `status` and hence that is used throughout this example.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/rmst/SASrmstreg2.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Issue 2:** page 8616 tells us that if we omit the option `tau=xx` then SAS sets tau using the largest **event** time. However, what SAS actually does is use the largest `time` from either events or censored observations which will result in an incorrect analysis. Therefore, you must calculate tau yourself (using events only) and include it as an option in the SAS code.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/rmst/SASrmstreg1.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Data used\n\nWe are using the lung_cancer.csv dataset found [here](CAMIS/data%20at%20main%20Â·%20PSIAIMS/CAMIS) with some manipulation as shown below.\n\nWe just create a `cnsr` variable to use in the analysis which has 165 events, and 63 censored values.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.eval .cell-code}\ndata adcibc (keep=age sex trt time cnsr);\n  set lung_cancer;\n  if _N_<=100 then trt=\"PBO\";\n  else trt=\"Active\";\n  if status=1 then cnsr=1;\n  else cnsr=0;\nrun; \n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe data consist of:\n\n-   time - Time(days) to event\n\n-   cnsr - 1=censored, 0=event\n\n-   age - Age of subject\n\n-   sex - 1=male, 2 = female\n\n-   trt - PBO or Act\n\n-   ref- column of 1's just used for sorting\n\nFor example:\n\n| time | cnsr | trt | age | sex | ref |\n|------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 279  | 1    | Act | 64  | 1   | 1   |\n| 276  | 1    | Act | 52  | 2   | 1   |\n| 79   | 0    | Act | 64  | 2   | 1   |\n| 654  | 0    | PBO | 68  | 2   | 1   |\n\n## Example Code using proc rmstreg\n\nFirstly we have to calculate tau from the data we have (using events only - cnsr=0). As explained in issue 2 above, if you do not do this SAS uses both events and censored observations to calculate tau, which is incorrect. The below calculates `tau` as 883 (highest event time). Following the calculation of tau, we then fit the proc rmstreg as shown.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproc sort data=adcibc (where=(cnsr=0)) out=timord;\n  by ref time;\nrun;\n\ndata adcibc2;\n  set adcibc ;\n  by ref time;\n  if last.ref then call symput(\"_tau\",put(time,best8.));\nrun;\n\n%put &_tau;\n\nproc rmstreg data=adtte tau=&_tau;\nclass trtp sex;\n model aval*cnsr(1) =trtp sex age /link=linear method=ipcw (strata=trtp);\n lsmeans trtp/pdiff=control('Placebo') cl alpha=0.05;\nods output lsmeans=lsm diffs= diff;\nRun;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nTo ensure you have the cnsr/event flag the right way around and tau set correctly, check the output closely. As you can see in the images below, tau=883 and number of events = 165 which is correct.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/rmst/rmstreg_output1.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe above model results in a difference in expected value of the time-to-event (Active-Placebo) of -57 days.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/rmst/rmstreg_output2.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHowever, fitting the analysis without the tau=XX option, you can see that the output shows tau =1022 which is the highest censored observation. This can radically change the analysis and should not be used. In this example, the difference in expected value of the time-to-event for Active-Placebo estimated at -65 days.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproc rmstreg data=adtte ;\nclass trtp sex;\n model aval*cnsr(0) =trtp sex age /link=linear method=ipcw (strata=trtp);\n lsmeans trtp/pdiff=control('Placebo') cl alpha=0.05;\nods output lsmeans=lsm diffs= diff;\nRun;\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/rmst/rmstreg_output3.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/rmst/rmstreg_output4.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n",
