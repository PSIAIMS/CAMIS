However, it can be generalized to tables of X x Y x K dimensions.\n\n## CMH in SAS\n\nThe cmh test is calculated in SAS using the PROC FREQ procedure. By default, it outputs the chi square statistic, degrees of freedom and p-value for each of the three alternative hypothesis: `general association`, `row means differ`, and `nonzero correlation`. It is up to the statistical analyst or statistician to know which result is appropriate for their analysis.\n\nWhen the design of the contingency table is 2 x 2 x K (i.e, X == 2 levels, Y == 2 levels, K \\>= 2 levels), the Mantel-Haenszel Common Odds Ratio (odds ratio estimate, 95% CI, P-value) and the Breslow-Day Test for Homogeneity of the Odds Ratios (chi-square statistic, degrees of freedom, P-value) are also output.\n\nBelow is the syntax to conduct a CMH analysis in SAS:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nProc freq data = filtered_data; \ntables K * X * Y / cmh; \n* the order of K, X, and Y appearing on the line is important!;\nrun; \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# References\n\nSAS documentation (Specification): https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/9.4_3.3/statug/statug_freq_examples07.htm\n\nSAS documentation (Theoretical Basis + Formulas): https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/9.4_3.5/procstat/procstat_freq_details92.htm\n",
