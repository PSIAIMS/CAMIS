The dataset is available at (../data/htwt.csv) and is imported to sas using proc import procedure.\n \n### Descriptive Statistics\n\nThe first step is to obtain the simple descriptive statistics for the numeric variables of htwt data, and one-way frequencies for categorical variables. This is accomplished by employing proc means and proc freq procedures There are 237 participants who are from 13.9 to 25 years old. It is a cross-sectional study, with each participant having one observation. We can use this data set to examine the relationship of participants' height to their age and sex.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproc means data=htwt;\nrun;\n\n                    Descriptive Statistics for HTWT Data Set                  \n                             The MEANS Procedure\n\nVariable  Label     N          Mean       Std Dev       Minimum       Maximum\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAGE       AGE     237    16.4430380     1.8425767    13.9000000    25.0000000\nHEIGHT    HEIGHT  237    61.3645570     3.9454019    50.5000000    72.0000000\nWEIGHT    WEIGHT  237   101.3080169    19.4406980    50.5000000   171.5000000\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproc freq data=htwt;\ntables sex;\nrun;\n\n    Oneway Frequency Tabulation for Sex for HTWT Data Set                    \n                    The FREQ Procedure\n\n                                      Cumulative    Cumulative\nSEX         Frequency     Percent     Frequency      Percent\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nf           111           46.84           111        46.84\nm           126           53.16           237       100.00\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIn order to create a regression model to demonstrate the relationship between age and height for females, we first need to create a flag variable identifying females and an interaction variable between age and female gender flag.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata htwt2;\n  set htwt;\n  if sex=\"f\" then female=1;\n  if sex=\"m\" then female=0; \n \n  *model to demonstrate interaction between female gender and age;\n  fem_age = female * age;  \nrun;\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Regression Analysis\nNext, we fit a regression model, representing the relationships between gender, age, height and the interaction variable created in the datastep above. We again use a where statement to restrict the analysis to those who are less than or equal to 19 years old. We use the clb option to get a 95% confidence interval for each of the parameters in the model. The model that we are fitting is ***height = b0 + b1 x female + b2 x age + b3 x fem_age + e***\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproc reg data=htwt2;\n  where age <=19;\n  model height = female age fem_age / clb;\nrun; quit;\n\n                        Number of Observations Read         219\n                        Number of Observations Used         219\n\n                                 Analysis of Variance\n\n                                        Sum of           Mean\n    Source                   DF        Squares         Square    F Value    Pr > F\n    Model                     3     1432.63813      477.54604      60.93    <.0001\n    Error                   215     1684.95730        7.83701\n    Corrected Total         218     3117.59543\n\n                 Root MSE              2.79947    R-Square     0.4595\n                 Dependent Mean       61.00457    Adj R-Sq     0.4520\n                 Coeff Var             4.58895\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe examine the parameter estimates in the output below.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n                            Parameter Estimates\n                            Parameter       Standard\n       Variable     DF       Estimate          Error    t Value    Pr > |t|       95% Confidence Limits\n       Intercept     1       28.88281        2.87343      10.05      <.0001       23.21911       34.54650\n       female        1       13.61231        4.01916       3.39      0.0008        5.69031       21.53432\n       AGE           1        2.03130        0.17764      11.44      <.0001        1.68117        2.38144\n       fem_age       1       -0.92943        0.24782      -3.75      0.0002       -1.41791       -0.44096\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nFrom the parameter estimates table the coefficients b0,b1,b2,b3 are estimated as b0=28.88 b1=13.61 b2=2.03 b3=-0.92942\n\nThe resulting regression model for height, age and gender based on the available data is ***height=28.88281 + 13.61231 x female + 2.03130 x age -0.92943 x fem_age***\n",
