Bartel J. Law M. Bateman M. Klatt NE. et al.Â Prospective evaluation of prognostic variables from patient-completed questionnaires. North Central Cancer Treatment Group. Journal of Clinical Oncology. 12(3):601-7, 1994.*\n\nSurvival in patients with advanced lung cancer from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. Performance scores rate how well the patient can perform usual daily activities.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `CORR` procedure computes Pearson correlation coefficients, three nonparametric measures of association, and the probabilities associated with these statistics. The correlation statistics include the following:\n\n-   Pearson product-moment correlation\n\n-   Spearman rank-order correlation\n\n-   Kendall's tau-b coefficient\n\n-   Hoeffding's measure of dependence, ![](https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/procstat/63104/HTML/default/images/procstat_corr0001.png){alt=\"\"}\n\n-   Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall partial correlation\n\nThis program works on the first three correlation coefficients.\n\n**Missing Values**\n\nPROC CORR excludes observations with missing values in the WEIGHT and FREQ variables. By default, PROC CORR uses ***pairwise deletion*** when observations contain missing values. PROC CORR includes all nonmissing pairs of values for each pair of variables in the statistical computations. Therefore, the correlation statistics might be based on different numbers of observations.\n\nIf you specify the NOMISS option, PROC CORR uses ***listwise deletion*** when a value of the VAR or WITH statement variable is missing. PROC CORR excludes all observations with missing values from the analysis. Therefore, the number of observations for each pair of variables is identical.\n\nThe PARTIAL statement always excludes the observations with missing values by automatically invoking the NOMISS option. With the NOMISS option, the data are processed more efficiently because fewer resources are needed. Also, the resulting correlation matrix is nonnegative definite.\n\nIn contrast, if the data set contains missing values for the analysis variables and the NOMISS option is not specified, the resulting correlation matrix might not be nonnegative definite. This leads to several statistical difficulties if you use the correlations as input to regression or other statistical procedures.\n\n## **Pearson Correlation**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproc corr data=lung pearson;\nvar age mealcal;\nrun;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n![](/images/correlation/pearson.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## **Spearman Correlation**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproc corr data=lung spearman; \nvar age mealcal; \nrun;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n![](/images/correlation/spearman.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Kendall's rank correlation\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproc corr data=lung kendall;\nvar age mealcal;\nrun;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n![](/images/correlation/kendall.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## References\n\n[PROC CORR: The CORR Procedure (sas.com)](https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/procstat/63104/HTML/default/viewer.htm#corr_toc.htm)\n",
