It's particularly useful when the sample distributions are not normally distributed and the sample sizes are small (typically less than 30).\n\n## Wilcoxon Rank Sum / Mann-Whitney U in SAS\n\nTo perform a Wilcoxon rank-sum test in SAS, you can use the PROC NPAR1WAY procedure. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1.  **Create the Dataset**: If there are two groups (smoker and non-smoker) with their respective measurements birth weight, you can input the data as follows:\n\n\n```{sas}\n#| eval: false\n/* Create dataset */\ndata bw;\n    input bw  grp $;\n    datalines;\n3.99    ns\n3.89    ns\n3.6     ns\n3.73    ns\n3.31    ns\n3.7     ns\n4.08    ns\n3.61    ns\n3.83    ns\n3.41    ns\n4.13    ns\n3.36    ns\n3.54    ns\n3.51    ns\n2.71    ns\n3.18    s\n2.74    s\n2.9     s\n3.27    s\n3.65    s\n3.42    s\n3.23    s\n2.86    s\n3.6     s\n3.65    s\n3.69    s\n3.53    s\n2.38    s\n2.34    s\n;\nrun;\n```\n\n\n2.  **Perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum Test**: Use the PROC NPAR1WAY procedure to perform the test. The wilcoxon option specifies that you want to perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. When computing the asymptotic Wilcoxon two-sample test, PROC NPAR1WAY uses a continuity correction by default. If specify the CORRECT=NO option in the PROC NPAR1WAY statement, the procedure does not use a continuity correction. Typically, we will also want the Hodges-Lehman confidence intervals. To get these you will need to add `hl` to the pro npar1way statement.\n\n\n```{sas}\n#| eval: false\n/* Perform Wilcoxon rank-sum test - with continuity correction by default*/\nproc npar1way data=BW wilcoxon hl;\n    class grp;\n    var bw;\nrun;\n\n/* Perform Wilcoxon rank-sum test - without continuity correction*/\nproc npar1way data=BW wilcoxon CORRECT=NO hl;\n    class grp;\n    var bw;\nrun;\n```\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Wilcoxon rank-sum test - with continuity correction by default\n\n![](/images/ranksum/ranksum.png)\n\nAs seen above, SAS outputs a table of Wilcoxon Scores for birth weight by non-smoker and smoker: the number (N); the sum of scores; the expected sum of scores under the null hypothesis; the standard deviation under the null hypothesis, and the observed mean score. The table also includes a footnote to specify that ties were handled by using the average score.\n\nSAS also outputs a table of Wilcoxon Two-sample Test. This table includes a footnote to specify that a continuiity correction of 0.5 is used.\n\n**Statistic**: 150.5000\n\n**Z**: -2.5756 (This is the test statistic after applying a continuity correction of 0.5)\n\n**Pr \\< Z**: 0.0050 (This is the one-tailed p-value). The one-tailed p-value (Pr\\< Z) of 0.0050 suggests that there is a 0.5% chance of observing a test statistic as extreme as 1.2498 under the null hypothesis.\n\n**Pr \\> \\|Z\\|**: 0.0100 (This is the two-tailed p-value). The two-tailed p-value (Pr \\> \\|Z\\|) of 0.0100 suggests that there is a 1.00 % chance of observing a test statistic as extreme as 1.2498 in either direction under the null hypothesis.\n\nThe t-distribution approximations provide similar p-values, indicating the robustness of the results.\n\n**t Approximation Pr \\< Z**: 0.0078 (This is the one-tailed p-value using a t-distribution approximation)\n\n**t Approximation Pr \\> \\|Z\\|**: 0.0156 (This is the two-tailed p-value using a t-distribution approximation)\n\nSince the p-values (both one-tailed and two-tailed) are less than the common significance level (e.g., 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis. This means there is a significant difference between the two groups (ns and s) for the variable BW.\n\n### Wilcoxon rank-sum test - without continuity correction\n\n![](/images/ranksum/ranksum2.png)\n\nAs seen above, Wilcoxon Two-Sample Test results are changed because No continuity correction is used.\n\n### Hodges-Lehman\n\nThe correction does not effect the Hodges-Lehman CI. The Location shift is the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. By default the asymptotic (Moses) CI is shown.\n\n![](/images/ranksum/hl-ci.png)\n\n### Wilcoxon rank-sum test - Exact\n\nFor sufficiently small sample size, the large-sample normal approximation used by the asymptotic Wilcoxon might not be appropriate, so the exact statement is needed.\n\n\n```{sas}\n#| eval: false\n/* Perform Wilcoxon rank-sum test - with continuity correction by default*/\nproc npar1way data=BW wilcoxon CORRECT=NO hl;\n    class grp;\n    var bw;\n    exact wilcoxon hl;\nrun;\n```\n\n\n![](/images/ranksum/wrs-exact.png)\n\nThe exact hl part of that statement makes the exact and asymptotic Hodges-Lehmann CI appear.\n\n![](/images/ranksum/hl-exact.png)\n\n# References\n\n[SAS Help Center: TWOSAMPLEWILCOXON Statement](https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/statug/15.2/statug_power_syntax112.htm) [SAS Help Center: Overview: NPAR1WAY Procedure](https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/statug/15.2/statug_npar1way_overview.htm)\n\n*Data source: Table 30.4, Kirkwood BR. and Sterne JAC.
