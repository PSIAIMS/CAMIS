This procedure has options for Chi-Square and Fisher's Exact tests.\n\n# Example: Lung Cancer Data\n\nThe following tabulation was used for the SAS Chi-Square and Fisher's testing. This tabulation was derived from the same `lung` dataset used for the R function testing. The dataset is defined as follows:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.sas .cell-code}\ndata test_case; \n  input treatment $ Count Weight $; \n  datalines; \n  Trt_A 22 0\n  Trt_B 39 0\n  Trt_A 39 1\n  Trt_B 113 1\n; \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Tests of Association\n\nThe following SAS code produces both the Chi-Square and Fisher's Exact tests of association. Note that the results contain many statistics not produced by the corresponding R function. The relevant sections of the output have been outlined in red.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.sas .cell-code}\nproc freq data = test_case;\n    weight Count;\n    tables treatment * Weight / chisq fisher;\n    exact or;\nrun;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/association/sas_chisq_fisher.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n",
