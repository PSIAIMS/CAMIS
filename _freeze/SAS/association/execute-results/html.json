This procedure has options for Chi-Square and Fisher's Exact tests.\n\n# Example: Lung Cancer Data\n\nThe following tabulation was used for the SAS Chi-Square and Fisher's testing. This tabulation was derived from the same `lung` dataset used for the R function testing. The dataset is defined as follows:\n\n```         \ndata test_case; \ninput treatment $ Count Weight $; \ndatalines; \nTrt_A 22 0\nTrt_B 39 0\nTrt_A 39 1\nTrt_B 113 1\n; \n```\n\n## Tests of Association\n\nThe following SAS code produces both the Chi-Square and Fisher's Exact tests of association. Note that the results contain many statistics not produced by the corresponding R function. The relevant sections of the output have been outlined in red.\n\n```         \nproc freq data = test_case;\nweight Count;\ntables treatment * Weight / chisq fisher;\nexact or;\nrun;\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/association/sas_chisq_fisher.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n",
