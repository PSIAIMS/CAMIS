This is typically used for the 2-sample comparison with small sample size. Note: The Hodges-Lehman estimates the median of the difference and not the difference of the medians. The corresponding distribution-free confidence interval (CI) is also based on the Wilcoxon rank sum statistics (Moses). In addition, exact CIs can be constructed.\n\nPROC NPAR1WAY provides these estimates in a flexible manner.\n\n*Hodges, J. L. and Lehmann, E. L.

The direction of the comparison can be controlled via refclass. If the exact confidence interval is required additionally then the exact statement together with the option HL needs to be defined. The Hodges-Lehmann point estimate and confidence interval can be addressed via the HodgesLehmann option under the ODS statement.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproc npar1way hl (refclass = \"B\") data = all ;\n   class group ;\n   var value ;\n   exact hl ;\n   ods select HodgesLehmann ;\nrun ;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Results\n\nThe NPAR1WAY Procedure\n\n```         \n                                           Hodges-Lehmann Estimation                                                \n                                                                                                                    \n                                        Location Shift (A - B)    0.5600                                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                                                                   Interval        Asymptotic                       \n                   Type                 95% Confidence Limits      Midpoint    Standard Error                       \n                                                                                                                    \n                   Asymptotic (Moses)     -0.3700      1.1830        0.4065            0.3962                       \n                   Exact                  -0.2200      1.0820        0.4310                                         \n```\n",
