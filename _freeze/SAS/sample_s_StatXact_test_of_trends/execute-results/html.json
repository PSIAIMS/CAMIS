It's mostly used to analyse data where one variable is a binomial and the other is an ordinal variable. Basically, the test checks if the proportions vary in a specific direction (increasing or decreasing) when the ordered variable changes.\n\nIn the examples below we will calculate the extract and asymptotic powers and sample size of the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Analysis is not available in SAS and need to be run in StatXact PROC (module to SAS from Cytel).\n\nThe below parameters are need for the calculations:\n\n-   ω_i - dose level/exposure for he i-th group\n-   n_i - number of subjects in i-th group\n-   π_1 - baseline response probability\n-   π_i - response (binomial) probability for i-th group\n-   λ (lambda) - slope for the logit model, can be interpreted as change in the log-odds of response per unit increase in dose\n-   α - significance level for one-sided trend test\n-   β - required power\n\nIn StatXact we can directly specify all of the response probabilities, or we can specify the baseline probability and use the below logit model with prespecified slope lambda to derive the rest:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/samplesize/StatXact_logit.PNG){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Example 1 - Power for dose finding pilot study {.unnumbered}\n\nLet's consider an example of a dose-finding phase I clinical trial of patients with advanced chronic disease. At the lowest dose level the response probability is known to be 0.001. The drug will be considered useful if the log odds of response increase by 0.5 per unit increase in dose (that defines the lambda). The study design assumes doubling the dose up to maximum of 16 units. Sample sizes of 10, 10, 10, 5 and 2, are proposed for the five dose levels, to restrict the total number of subjects at the two highest dose levels due to possible side effects. A one-sided Cochran-Armitage trend test at the 2.5% significance level will performed at the end of the study. What is the power?\n\nDesign parameter are as below:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/samplesize/StatXact3.PNG){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSAS code:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproc sxpowerbin;\ntr/ex;\npalpha 0.025;\nk 5;\nH0 0.001;\nH1 logodds /val=0.5;\nscores 1 2 4 8 16;\nsize1 10;\nsize2 10;\nsize3 10;\nsize4 5;\nsize5 2;\nrun;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nOutput from StatXact and results:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/samplesize/StatXact1.PNG){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe exact power is 48%, whilst the asymptotic power is 84%. Here, using the asymptotic power would have led to a false sense of security concerning the adequacy of the proposed sample sizes for carrying out this pilot study.\n\n#### Example 2 - Power for cohort study of effects of low dose radiation {.unnumbered}\n\nLet's consider an example of a long-term follow-up study of subjects exposed to low-dose radiation in Japan (adapted from Landis, Heyman and Koch, 1978). The cohort was partitioned into four groups based on average radiation exposures of 0, 5, 30 and 75 rads. There were 2500, 3600, 1450 and 410 subjects, respectively, in the four dose groups. Subjects were classified as responders if they died from leukemia and non-responders if they died from other causes. We want detect a trend parameter of 0.049 on the logit scale, given a background response rate of 1 in 10,000. A one-sided Cochran-Armitage trend test at the 5% significance level was performed at the end of the study. What was the power?\n\nDesign parameter are as below:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/samplesize/StatXact5.PNG){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSAS code:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproc sxpowerbin;\ntr/ex dist_file=tr;\npalpha 0.05;\nk 4;\nH0 0.0001;\nH1 logodds /val=0.049;\nscores 0 5 30 75;\nsize1 2500;\nsize2 3600;\nsize3 1450;\nsize4 410;\nrun;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nOutput from StatXact and results:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/samplesize/StatXact4.PNG){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAsymptotic power of the test is 77%, a considerable overestimate of the actual power, 60%.\n\n#### Example 3 - Sample size calculation for trend test {.unnumbered}\n\nLet's consider an example of the study where the design parameters are as below:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/samplesize/StatXact6.PNG){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the required sample size to achieve the power of 80% with the significance level 5%?\n\nSAS code:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproc sxpowerbin ti =15;\ntr/ex;\npalpha 0.05;\nbeta 0.8;\nk 5;\nH0 0.10;\nH1 user/val=0.13 0.16 0.19 0.22;\nscores 0 1 2 4 8;\nrun;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n(option ti = 15 limits the maximum time of computation to 15 min)\n\nOutput from StatXact and results:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/samplesize/StatXact7.PNG){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSample size of 108 is needed to obtain the required power.\n\n#### References {.unnumbered}\n\nAll of the examples are adapted from StatXact 12 PROCs Manual.\n",
