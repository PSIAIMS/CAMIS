## How to get involved

CAMIS is a community effort. Although this project does have a core team, the endeavor of tracking all these comparisons will fail without community contributions. We appreciate all contributions, big or small!

You can get involved in the following ways:

-   join our monthly online meetings
-   **report a difference** or request a new method by [filing an issue](https://github.com/PSIAIMS/CAMIS/issues/)
-   contribute to our documentation

## How to contribute to the documentation

Please contribute by **submitting a pull request** (PR) and our team will review it.

### Adding a new page

If you are adding a new page, please follow our template guideline: [R template](https://github.com/PSIAIMS/CAMIS/blob/main/templates/template.qmd)

Good documentation on data, methods are very much appreciated!

### First-time contributors

Welcome to CAMIS! Please read this article: [Get started](get_started.qmd), which contains some useful information to help you navigate your first PR submission.
