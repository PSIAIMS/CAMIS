    NOTE:  We will only collect: team members name, email address, organization, software used, interested in oncology, key interests and affiliations to stats organizations.  The email address is solely for the CAMIS leadership team, to make sure you are included in CAMIS emails.\
    We ask on the form: "Are you happy for your Name and company and interests to be visible on the CAMIS website. Note that email addresses will not be visible". 

    If you do not give permission then your name will not appear on the CAMIS repo as a CAMIS team member. If you do give permission, your name and company and interests will appear but your email addresses will be hidden from public view. At any time you can ask to be removed from the website team list by emailing me.
