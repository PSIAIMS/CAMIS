# Agenda & Minutes

## 2024 Goals

-   Our open issues are [here](https://github.com/PSIAIMS/CAMIS/issues)\
    Currently 32 are closed and we would like to increase this to 45 closed by the end of the year
-   In addition, we'd like to improve some of the incomplete content such as MMRM
-   Create a webpage for listings dissertation projects
-   Have Soma & Vikash represent us at the CSS workshop.

## CAMIS - Onco

To date there has not been much progress. Given the enthusiasm in the meeting to get things kicked off and starting to increase our survival content on the repository, Christina will set up a kick off meeting for those interested. To look at: weighted logrank, MaxCombo, RMST

## Other content updates

We now have a new table of assignments saved in the following [readme](https://github.com/PSIAIMS/CAMIS/tree/main/non_website_content) Welcome to edit to update anything you would like to work on, so we keep track of whose working on what. Special shout out to David who has now completed chi-square for SAS and to Lukas for all the python content. Awesome work !

As SAS Viya is becoming more used now, we agreed OK to add Viya specific code such as proc freqtab as long as it's clear that this isn't a SAS Base procedure.
