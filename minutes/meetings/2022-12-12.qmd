-   Name change: CAMIS: Comparing analysis method implementations in software
-   Do we need our own logo. CAMIS. Volunteers?
-   Supported by PHUSE & PSI & ASA. Assign rep (or reps) for each organization.
-   Extend membership given many previous members no longer on project
-   Volunteer needed – can someone create a comparison using any method (but comparing SAS to Python/Julia or R to Python/Julia) – so we can test up with not just R Vs SAS.
-   AOB.
