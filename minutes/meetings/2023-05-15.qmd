# Meeting minutes

**White Paper Update: Min-Hua** Paula at PHUSE will distribute for public review. Over the next days we'll get a link to the official review. ACTION :Christina will put the white paper onto the website as draft open for public review

**Website progress: Christina** Website content progressing well. Ben Arancibia - progressing MMRMs + other areas.\
Survival - With Christina to fix importing. ANCOVA - Aditee in progress - change to CSV not SAV (SPSS file). Update to call it linear regression, Lyn to help find ANCOVA (testing treatments) Independant Two-Sample t-test in SAS - Vikash got a few changes then will load ok.

Lyn: To create a FAQ doc for the website. Make sure it references available material elsewhere so it doesn't become out of date quickly.

NOTE: When you do a pull request, check your action to see if the checks pass/fail & reach out to Lyn/CHristina if you have problems. Remember to do snapshot::renv, so that any packages you install were snapshot to the central repo. Else it will fail when you do the pull request as the repo wont have the packages in it that your code needs.

**Launch Update**

ACTION : Lyn/Christina to Add a disclaimer that we are volunteers adding open source content, but if you see anything that infringes copyright please let us know and we'll remove it immediately.

Then highlight what's missing - what else you want to add. Max combo. BICR vs RECIST? In future we can discuss how these fit with current CAMIS structure. Focus on the Stats method ideally.
