    -   MMRM - Volunteer please to look at Proc Mixed vs Proc GLIMMIX and use this to expand the SAS/mmrm.qmd file.

    -   Keaven Anderson (Merck) - will start to look at SAS vs R for sample size / group sequential design / power. They use EAST, gsDesign, but others use rpact. Does anyone have experience of this (& using SAS for sample size)? Lyn & Martin & Keaven will meet to discuss on Friday.

    -   Christina: will add sales pitch to Website - Why CAMIS !? + re-arrangment of some of the content.

-   **Objective to get more regulatory input**\
    Work with PSI AIMS as they plan a EMA regulatory panel discussion on R Any other ideas?\
    FDA/ Other regulators input/discussion.

-   **Git training plan for 2024** PSI conference abstract rejected. Creation of a short training session (like the R/pharma workshop) or 6 week 2 hr/ week course. ACTION: Lyn/Christina/Martin to follow up with PSI re: delivery of training. Restart GIT training meetings (Christina/Alex/ Irene)

-   **Interaction with more Academics & Universities**\
    Please can you present/advertise to your universities contacts. Anyone got contacts they can utilize? Ideas for spreading the word? Lyn doing Presentation at University of Sheffield on 28th Feb for RSS local group.

-   **Academia Projects** ALL: to think about possible dissertation projects. Plan to list available projects in repo & write descriptions of what the project would entail such that universities students can use them at dissertation projects Prof Richard Stevens (Oxford) is open to projects if we have any. Also Novonordisk : working with Alberg Denmark university to have a proposal for project.

-   **Raising awareness within companies to flag issues to CAMIS**\
    ALL: brainstorm how we can spread awareness within our organization & wider community

    EFSPI - PSI strategy day / heads meeting\
    ASA OpenStatsware - Orla Doyle: Focus is more on package development. If a gap comes up we could make them aware package is needed. Can also look to sassy r package to see if that replicates SAS (if it's right to do so) David Bosak. Lyn meeting with David next later this week.\
    \
    Plan for next Blogs:

1)  add blog tab to repo, then when we post we can link through.
2)  Ideas for next blogs? - perhaps pick a topic we have content already for & post blog on it.

-   **Funding requirements** NOTE: We can apply for a grant for any funding if anyone sees an opportunity to progress our work quicker through this method. NOTE: if any university project or individuals need funding to do this CAMIS work (creation of content), then we do have an option to apply to the R Consortium for funding.

-   **AOB**

    -   Linear Regression SAS & R, text are now live on website. Results match, but would be good to add a COMP file which just says what we checked & what matched... for example incase something comes up in future that does not match.
