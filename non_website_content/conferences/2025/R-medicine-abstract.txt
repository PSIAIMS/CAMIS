Unlocking Statistical Consistency Across Platforms: The CAMIS Project 

As we transition to a world of multilingual programming, replication across software is critical. Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software (CAMIS) is an open-source repository dedicated to documenting the differences in statistical methodologies across a variety of software platforms such as SAS, R, Python, StatXact, and EAST. In the rigorously regulated medical research industry, ensuring the accuracy of results requires double or even triple programming, demanding matches in results from disparate systems.

We'll introduce the PHUSE CAMIS project, which delves into the nuances between different software implementations of methods. All relevant code, case studies, results, and findings are stored in our GitHub repository (https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/).

Through practical examples, we highlight observed discrepancies and pitfalls and how CAMIS helps to bridge a userâ€™s understanding across software. Beyond asking whether results match, we'll emphasize the importance of assessing the robustness of the software packages and libraries generating these results.

Participants will gain valuable tools for efficiently investigating software discrepancies faced in daily tasks. We will address concerns and reassure current and future R users that, in most cases, results can be replicated across platforms. For those instances where replication fails, the CAMIS repository offers clear explanations to guide your understanding and resolution.
