# **Two Sample t-test in R**

The Two Sample t-test is used to compare two independent samples against each other. In the Two Sample t-test, the mean of the first sample is compared against the mean of the second sample. In R, a Two Sample t-test can be performed using the Base R `t.test()` function from the **stats** package or the `proc_ttest()` function from the **procs** package.

### Data Used

The following data was used in this example.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# Create sample data
d1 <- tibble::tribble(
  ~trt_grp,	~WtGain,
  "placebo",	94, "placebo",	12, "placebo",	26, "placebo",	89,
  "placebo",	88, "placebo",	96, "placebo",	85, "placebo",	130,
  "placebo",	75, "placebo",	54, "placebo",	112, "placebo",	69,
  "placebo",	104, "placebo",	95, "placebo",	53, "placebo",	21,
  "treatment",	45, "treatment",	62, "treatment",	96, "treatment",	128,
  "treatment",	120, "treatment",	99, "treatment",	28, "treatment",	50,
  "treatment",	109, "treatment",	115, "treatment",	39, "treatment",	96,
  "treatment",	87, "treatment",	100, "treatment",	76, "treatment",	80
)
```

## Base R

If we have normalized data, we can use the classic Student's t-test. For a Two sample test where the variances are not equal, we should use the Welch's t-test. Both of those options are available with the Base R `t.test()` function.

### Student's T-Test {#baseS}

#### Code

The following code was used to test the comparison in Base R. By default, the R two sample t-test function assumes the variances in the data are unequal, and uses a Welch's t-test. Therefore, to use a classic Student's t-test with normalized data, we must specify `var.equal = TRUE`.
Also note that we must separate the single variable into two variables to satisfy the `t.test()` syntax and set `paired = FALSE`.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE}

  d1p <- dplyr::filter(d1, trt_grp == 'placebo')
  d1t <- dplyr::filter(d1, trt_grp == 'treatment')

  # Perform t-test
  t.test(d1p$WtGain, d1t$WtGain, 
       var.equal = TRUE, paired = FALSE)

```

### Welch's T-Test {#baseW}

#### Code

The following code was used to test the comparison in Base R using Welch's t-test. Observe that in this case, the `var.equal` parameter is set to FALSE.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE}

  d1p <- dplyr::filter(d1, trt_grp == 'placebo')
  d1t <- dplyr::filter(d1, trt_grp == 'treatment')

  # Perform t-test
  t.test(d1p$WtGain, d1t$WtGain, 
       var.equal = FALSE, paired = FALSE)

```

## Procs Package

### Student's T-Test and Welch's T-Test {#procs}

#### Code

The following code from the **procs** package was used to perform a two sample t-test. Note that the `proc_ttest()` function performs both the Student's t-test and Welch's (Satterthwaite) t-test in the same call. The results are displayed on separate rows. This output is similar to SAS.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  library(procs)

  # Perform t-test
  proc_ttest(d1, var = WtGain,
             class = trt_grp)
```

Viewer Output:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
