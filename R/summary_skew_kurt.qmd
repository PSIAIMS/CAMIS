# **Skewness and Kurtosis in R**

Skewness measures the the amount of asymmetry in a distribution, while Kurtosis describes the "tailedness" of the curve.
These measures are frequently used to assess the normality of the data.
There are several methods to calculate these measures.  In R, there are at least four different packages that contain functions
for Skewness and Kurtosis.  This write-up will examine the following packages: **e1071**, **moments**, **procs**, 
and **sasLM**.

## Data Used

The following data was used in this example.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# Create sample data
dat <- tibble::tribble(
  ~team, ~points, ~assists,
  "A", 10, 2,
  "A", 17, 5,
  "A", 17, 6,
  "A", 18, 3,
  "A", 15, 0,
  "B", 10, 2,
  "B", 14, 5,
  "B", 13, 4,
  "B", 29, 0,
  "B", 25, 2,
  "C", 12, 1,
  "C", 30, 1,
  "C", 34, 3,
  "C", 12, 4,
  "C", 11, 7 
)
```

## Package Examination 

Base R and the **stats** package have no native functions for Skewness and Kurtosis. It is therefore necessary to use a packaged
function to calculate these statistics. The packages examined use three different methods of calculating Skewness, and four different methods
for calculating Kurtosis.  Of the available packages, the functions in the **e1071** package provide the most 
flexibility, and have options for three of the different methodologies.

### e1071 Package {#e1071}

The **e1071** package contains miscellaneous statistical functions from the Probability Theory Group at the Vienna University of Technology.
The package includes functions for both Skewness and Kurtosis, and each function has a "type" parameter to specify the method.  There are 
three available methods for Skewness, and three methods for Kurtosis. A portion of the documentation for these functions is included below:

#### Skewness 

The documentation for the `skewness()` function describes three types of skewness calculations:
Joanes and Gill (1998) discusses three methods for estimating skewness:

-   Type 1: This is the typical definition used in many older textbooks

$$g_1 = m_1/m_2^{3/2}$$

-   Type 2: Used in SAS and SPSS

    $$
    G_1 = g_1\sqrt{n(n-1)}/(n-2)
    $$

-   Type 3: Used in MINITAB and BMDP

    $$
    b_1 = m_3/s^3 = g_1((n-1)/n)^{3/2}
    $$

All three skewness measures are unbiased under normality. The three methods are illustrated in the following code:

```{r eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


type1 <- e1071::skewness(dat$points, type = 1)
stringr::str_glue("Skewness - Type 1: {type1}")
  
type2 <- e1071::skewness(dat$points, type = 2)
stringr::str_glue("Skewness - Type 2: {type2}")
  
type3 <- e1071::skewness(dat$points, type = 3)
stringr::str_glue("Skewness - Type 3: {type3}")
```
The default for the **e1071** `skewness()` function is Type 3.

#### Kurtosis

The documentation for the `kurtosis()` function describes three types of kurtosis calculations:
Joanes and Gill (1998) discuss three methods for estimating kurtosis:

-   Type 1: This is the typical definition used in many older textbooks

$$g_2 = m_4/m_2^{2}-3$$

-   Type 2: Used in SAS and SPSS

    $$G_2 = ((n+1)g_2+6)*\frac{(n-1)}{(n-2)(n-3)}$$

-   Type 3: Used in MINITAB and BMDP

    $$b_2 = m_4/s^4-3 = (g_2 + 3)(1-1/n)^2-3$$

Only $G_2$ (corresponding to type 2) is unbiased under normality. The three methods are illustrated in the following code:

```{r eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


  # Kurtosis - Type 1
type1 <- e1071::kurtosis(dat$points, type = 1)
stringr::str_glue("Kurtosis - Type 1: {type1}")
  
# Kurtosis - Type 2
type2 <- e1071::kurtosis(dat$points, type = 2)
stringr::str_glue("Kurtosis - Type 2: {type2}")
  
# Kurtosis - Type 3
type3 <- e1071::kurtosis(dat$points, type = 3)
stringr::str_glue("Kurtosis - Type 3: {type3}")
```
The default for the **e1071** `kurtosis()` function is Type 3.

### Moments Package {#moments}

The **moments** package is a well-known package with a variety of statistical functions.  The package contains functions for
both Skewness and Kurtosis.  But these functions provide no "type" option.  The `skewness()` function in the **moments** package
corresponds to Type 1 above.  The `kurtosis()` function uses a Pearson's measure of Kurtosis, which corresponds to none of the
three types in the **e1071** package.


```{r eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

  library(moments)

  # Skewness - Type 1
  moments::skewness(dat$points)
  # [1] 0.9054442
  
  # Kurtosis - Pearson's measure
  moments::kurtosis(dat$points)
  # [1] 2.416659

```
Note that neither of the functions from the **moments** package match SAS.

### Procs Package {#procs}

The **procs** package `proc_means()` function was written specifically to match SAS, and produces a Type 2 Skewness and Type 2 Kurtosis.
This package also produces a data frame output, instead of a scalar value.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

  library(procs)

  # Skewness and Kurtosis - Type 2 
  proc_means(dat, var = points,
             stats = v(skew, kurt))

```


Viewer Output:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/summarystats/procs_skewness_kurtosis.png")
```

### sasLM Package {#sasLM}

The **sasLM** package was also written specifically to match SAS.  The `Skewness()` function produces a Type 2 Skewness,
and the `Kurtosis()` function a Type 2 Kurtosis.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

  library(sasLM)

  # Skewness - Type 2
  Skewness(dat$points)
  # [1] 1.009318
  
  # Kurtosis - Type 2
  Kurtosis(dat$points)
  # [1] -0.2991564

```
