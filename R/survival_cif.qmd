title: "Estimating Cumulative Incidence Functions Using R"
---

## Objective

In this document we present how to estimate the cumulative incidence function (CIF) in R. We focus on the competing risks model where each subject experiences only one out of *k* possible events as depicted in the figure below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/survival_competing_risks/cr.jpg")
```

## R Packages

We identify three packages:

-   `cmprsk` 

-   `tidycmprsk` 

-   `survival` 

The `cmprsk` package implements the methods described in Gray (1988) for testing CIFs across different groups. The `tidycmprsk` package is a wrapper for `cmprsk`. It uses syntax similar to other survival analysis packages, and returns `survival` objects. In this document, we illustrate how to use the `tidycmprsk` package for estimating and testing CIFs. More details and other functionalities can be found [here](https://mskcc-epi-bio.github.io/tidycmprsk/ "tidycmprsk").

The `survival` package is a general purpose survival analysis package. Its scope is far beyond the competing risks model. We will demonstrate how to estimate the CIFs using this package.

### Data used

The bone marrow transplant (BTM) dataset as presented by Guo & So (2018) is used. The dataset has the following variables:

-   `Group` has three levels, indicating three disease groups: ALL, AML-Low Risk, AML-High Risk.

-   `T` is the disease-free survival time in days. A derived variable `TYears = T/365.25` is used in the analysis.

-   `Status` has value 0 if `T` is censored; 1 if `T` is time to relapse; 2 if `T` is time to death.

-   `WaitTime` is the waiting time to transplant in days. This variable is not used here.

-   A new variable `ID` is created.

```{r readdata, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(dplyr)
bmt <- haven::read_sas(file.path("../data/bmt.sas7bdat")) %>%
  mutate(
    Group = factor(Group, 
                   levels = c(1, 2, 3), 
                   labels = c('ALL', 'AML-Low Risk', 'AML-High Risk')
    ),
    Status = factor(Status,
                    levels = c(0, 1, 2),
                    labels = c('Censored', 'Relapse', 'Death')),
    TYears = T / 365.25,
    ID = row_number()
  )
```

## Estimating CIFs

### The `tidycmprsk` Package

#### CIF Estimates and Gray's Test

The `tidycmprsk::cuminc()` function requires a `Surv` object. Therefore, the first level of the event status variable (in this example `Status`) must represent censoring.

```{r cr.est, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(survival)
require(tidycmprsk)
require(tidyverse)
cif.1 <- cuminc(Surv(TYears, Status) ~ Group, data = bmt) 
```

Gray's test statistics and p-value:

```{r cr.test, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  glance(cif.1) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = c(".value", "outcome_id"),
    names_pattern = "(.*)_(.*)"
  )
)
```

CIF estimates for time to relapse at selected timepoints for 'AML-Low Risk' patients:

```{r cr.sum, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  cif.1 %>% 
  tidy(times = c(0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3)) %>%
  select(time, outcome, strata, estimate, std.error, conf.low, conf.high) %>% 
  filter(outcome == 'Relapse' & strata == 'AML-Low Risk') %>%
  mutate(time = as.character(time),
         across(where(is.numeric), ~ num(., digits = 4))
  )
)
```

Two points to note:

1.  The current version of `cmprsk`, and hence `tidycmprsk,` estimates the variance of the CIF estimates asymptotically as in Aalen (1978). There is no option to change it to other methods.

2.  `tidycmprsk::cuminc()` offers pointwise CIs for the CIF estimates using the log-log transforms. There is no other options.

#### CIF Plots

```{r cr.plot, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
require(ggsurvfit)
cif.1 %>%
  ggcuminc(outcome = 'Death') +
  ## add_confidence_interval() +
  add_risktable() +
  xlab('Time (years) to death')
cif.1 %>%
  ggcuminc(outcome = 'Relapse') +
  ## add_confidence_interval() +
  add_risktable() +
  xlab('Time (years) to relapse')
```

### The `survival` Package

#### CIF Estimates

Using the bone marrow transplant example, the following code shows how to estimate the CIF for time to relapse or to death:

```{r surv.est, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cif.2 <- survfit(Surv(TYears, Status) ~ Group,
                 data = bmt,
                 se.fit = TRUE,
                 conf.type = 'log-log', ## default is 'log'
                 id = ID,
                 robust = TRUE ## default for multi-state model
                 )
## summary(cif.2)
```

A few points to note:

1.  `survfit()` returns the probability of being in a state (`pstate`). The CIF is its complement, i.e., `CIF = 1 - pstate`.

2.  Gray's test for testing equality across groups is not performed.

3.  In this example `survfit()` recognizes that the input are in multi-state model format; therefore, it estimates the variances of the CIFs with an infinitesimal jackknife (see Therneau (2024)). The CIs, as a result, are different from that estimated based on Aalen's or the delta method as done in SAS PROC LIFETEST.

4.  The survival package also offers a different syntax for estimating CIFs. Users need to first call `finegray()` separately for each event to reformat the data, then apply `survfit()` for each event. The CIF estimates are identical since the same estimation method is used; the variances can be different from directly calling `survfit()` with data in multi-state model format, since `finegray()` artificially extends the observed time for the competing events (see Therneau (2024)).

#### CIF Plots

The same `ggcuminc()` syntax can be applied to the `survfit()` output `cif.2`.

## Summary

Both `tidycmprsk::cminc()` (as inherited from `cmprsk::cuminc()`) and `survival::survfit()` implement Aalen-Johansen estimator. For competing risks it reduces to CIF, which has a closed form formulation. The results are identical as produced by SAS PROC LIFETEST.

Certain options in SAS, e.g., the delta method for variance estimation or other types of transformation for calculating the CIs, are not available in the current versions of `tidycmprsk::cuminc()` or `survival::survfit()`. However, the outputs from both contain enough information that these options can be manually implemented by users. For example, Pintilie (2006) provides R code for deriving the variances for the estimated CIFs based on the delta method.
