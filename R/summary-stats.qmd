title: "Deriving Quantiles or Percentiles in R"
---

Percentiles can be calculated in R using the quantile function. The function has the argument `type` which allows for nine different percentile definitions to be used. The default is `type = 7`, which uses a piecewise-linear estimate of the cumulative distribution function to find percentiles.

This is how the 25th and 40th percentiles of `aval` could be calculated using the default `type`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#| echo: true
quantile(aval, probs = c(0.25, 0.4))
```

Note that by default missing values are not removed. To change this set the argument `na.rm` to `TRUE`
