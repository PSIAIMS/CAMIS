## Introduction

There are many different methods of calculating a confidence interval for a proportion (percentage). For more information about these methods in R & SAS, including which performs better in different scenarios see [Five Confidence Intervals for Proportions That You Should Know about](https://towardsdatascience.com/five-confidence-intervals-for-proportions-that-you-should-know-about-7ff5484c024f)^1^ and [Confidence Intervals for Binomial Proportion Using SAS](https://www.lexjansen.com/sesug/2015/103_Final_PDF.pdf)^2^

Proportions and Confidence intervals (CI) are commonly used with binary endpoints (e.g. 'response' vs 'non-response' or Yes vs No). This allows us to estimate the proportion in one treatment compared to the proportion in the other treatment. You can get estimates of the proportion and CI for proportion separately for each treatment or calculate the difference in proportion between the two treatments, and then calculate a CI for the difference in proportions. In this example, we will use 95% CIs.

## Data used

The adcibc data stored [here](../data/adcibc.csv) was used in this example, creating a binary treatment variable `trt` taking the values of `Act` or `PBO` and a binary response variable `resp` taking the values of `Yes` or `No`. For this example, a response is defined as a score greater than 4.

```{r}
#| eval: false
data adcibc2 (keep=trt resp) ;
    set adcibc;     
    if aval gt 4 then resp="Yes";
    else resp="No";     
    if trtp="Placebo" then trt="PBO";
    else trt="Act"; 
run;
```

For more information about the data, see the corresponding [R page](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/R/ci_for_prop.html).

## Simple 2x2 cross tabulation using PROC FREQ

It is good practice to visualize your data. For this we can do a 2x2 table with percentages.

```{r}
#| eval: false 
proc freq data=adcibc;
  table trt*resp/ nopct nocol;
run;
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}

```

## Methods for Calculating Confidence Intervals for Proportions

SAS PROC FREQ in Version 9.4 can compute 11 methods to calculate CIs for proportions, an explanation of these methods and the code is shown below. See [BINOMIAL](https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/procstat/63104/HTML/default/viewer.htm#procstat_freq_sect010.htm)^3^ for more information on SAS parameterization. It is recommended to always sort your data prior to doing a PROC FREQ.

### Clopper-Pearson (Exact or binomial CI) Method

With Binary endpoint data (response/non-response), we make the assumption that the proportion of responders, has been derived from a series of Bernoulli trials. Trials (Subjects) are independent and we have a fixed number of repeated trials with an outcome of respond or not respond. This type of data follows the discrete binomial probability distribution, and the Clopper-Pearson^4^ (Exact) method uses this distribution to calculate the CIs. However, for large numbers of trials (subjects), the probability distribution becomes difficult to calculate and hence a variety of approximations were developed all with their pros and cons (depending on your data distribution).

Clopper-Pearson method is output by SAS as the default method, but you can also specify it using `BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes" CL=CLOPPERPEARSON);`

### Normal Approximation (Wald or asymptotic CI) Method

The most commonly used alternative to the Clopper-Pearson (Exact) method is the asymptotic Normal Approximation (Wald) CI. In large random samples from independent trials, the sampling distribution of proportions approximately follows the normal distribution. The expectation of a sample proportion is the corresponding population proportion. Therefore, based on a sample of size $n$, a $(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for population proportion can be calculated using normal approximation as follows:

$p\approx \hat p \pm z_\alpha \sqrt{\hat p(1-\hat p)}/{n}$, where $\hat p$ is the sample proportion, $z_\alpha$ is the $1-\alpha/2$ quantile of a standard normal distribution corresponding to level $\alpha$, and $\sqrt{\hat p(1-\hat p)}/{n}$ is the standard error.

One should note that the approximation can become unreliable as the proportion of responders gets close to 0 or 1 (e.g. 0 or 100% responding), and alternative methods may be more suitable. In this scenario, common issues consist of:

-   it does not respect the 0 and 1 proportion boundary (so you can get a lower CI of -0.1 or an upper CI of 1.1%!)

-   the derived 95% CI may not cover the true proportion 95% of the time

Wald method can be derived with or without a Yate's continuity correction. Applying the continuity correction is recommended when you have a small sample size or the estimated proportion is close to the tail ends (0 or 1). Applying Yate's correction is considered more conservative but it's not as conservative as Clopper-Pearson approach.

Normal approximation method is output by SAS as the default method, but you can also specify it using `BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes" CL=WALD);`

SAS also produces a continuity correction version of the Wald method, you can specify it using `BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes" CL=WALD(CORRECT));`

### Wilson (score) Method

The Wilson (Score) method is an extension to the normal approximation, but commonly used where the proportion is close to 0 or 1 (100% responding). This is because the normal approximation can be unreliable at the tail ends of the distribution, and as such Wilson (Score) method can provide more reliable CIs. Wilson method can be derived with or without a Yate's continuity correction. Applying the continuity correction is recommended when you have a small sample size or the estimated proportion is close to the tail ends (0 or 1). Applying Yate's correction is considered more conservative (sometimes too conservative), but it's not as conservative as Clopper-Pearson approach.

Wilson (score) method is output by SAS using `BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes" CL=Wilson);`

SAS also produces a continuity correction version of the Wald method, you can specify it using `BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes" CL=WALD(CORRECT));`

### Agresti-Coull Method

Agresti-Coull Method is a 'simple solution' designed to improve coverage compared to the Wald method and still perform better than Clopper-Pearson particularly when the probability isn't in the mid-range (0.5). It is less conservative whilst still having good coverage. The only difference compared to the Wald method is that it adds two successes and two failures to the original observations (increasing the sample by 4 observations).

Agresti-Coull method is output by SAS using `BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes" CL=AGRESTICOULL);`

### LOGIT Method

Similar to Wald method in structure, but instead of using `p=r/n`, a logit transformation is applied: `exp(log (p/(1-p))).`

The logit method is often applied for odds ratios, but similar to the wald method it is often unreliable when n is small or p is close to 0 or 1.

LOGIT method is output by SAS using `BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes" CL=LOGIT);`

### Binomial based MidP Method

The MidP method is similar to the Clopper-Pearson method, but aims to reduce the conservatism. It's quite a complex method compared to the methods above.

MidP method is output by SAS using `BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes" CL=MIDP);`

### Likelihood Ratio Method

Likelihood Ratio method is output by SAS using `BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes" CL=LIKELIHOODRATIO);`

### Jeffreys Method

Jeffreys method is a Bayesian method calculated based on the non-informative Jeffreys prior for a binomial proportion. $$
(Beta (^k/_2 + ^1/_{2}, ^{(n-k)}/_2+^1/_2)_{\alpha}, Beta (^k/_2 + ^1/_{2}, ^{(n-k)}/_2+^1/_2)_{1-\alpha}
$$ Jeffreys method is output by SAS using `BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes" CL=Jeffreys);`

### Blaker Method

The Blaker method is a less conservative alternative to the Clopper-pearson exact test. It is also an exact method, but derives the CI by inverting the p-value function of an exact test.

The Clopper-pearson CI's are always wider and contain the Blaker CI limits. It's adoption has been limited due to the numerical algorithm taking longer to compute compared to some of the other methods especially when the sample size is large. NOTE: Klaschka and Reiczigel^5^ is yet another adaptation of this method.

BLAKER method is output by SAS using `BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes" CL=BLAKER);`

### Altman Newcombe Method^6^

Let p=r/n, where r= number of responses, and n=number of subjects, q=1-p, and z= the appropriate value from standard normal distribution:\
$$
z{_1-\alpha/2}
$$For example, for 95% confidence intervals, alpha=0.05, using standard normal tables, z in the equations below will take the value =1.96. Calculate 3 quantities

$$
A= 2r+z^2
$$

$$
B=z\sqrt(z^2 + 4rq)
$$ $$
C=2(n+z^2)
$$The Altman Newcombe method calculates the confidence interval (Low to High) as: (A-B)/C to (A+B)/C

Available by manual calculations in SAS only.

### Bayesian HPD Method

The Bayesian Highest Posterior Density interval, consists of drawing from the posterior distribution and forming a credible interval/region that has the shortest interval among all of the Bayesian credible intervals.

Available by manual calculations in SAS only.

## Example Code using PROC FREQ

By adding the option `BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes")` to your 'PROC FREQ', SAS outputs the Normal Approximation (Wald) and Clopper-Pearson (Exact) confidence intervals as two default methods, derived for the `Responders` = `Yes`. If you do not specify the `LEVEL` you want to model, then SAS assumes you want to model the first level that appears in the output (alphabetically).

**It is very important to ensure you are calculating the CI for the correct level! Check your output to confirm, you will see below it states `resp=Yes` !**

The output consists of the proportion of resp=Yes, the Asymptotic SE, 95% CIs using normal-approximation method, 95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson method (Exact), and then a Binomial test statistic and p-value for the null hypothesis of H0: Proportion = 0.5.

```{R}
#| eval: false
proc sort data=adcibc;
by trt; 
run; 

proc freq data=adcibc ; 
table resp/ nopct nocol BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes");
by trt;
run;
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%", fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/ci_for_prop/binomial_prop_act.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../images/ci_for_prop/binomial_prop_pbo.png")
```

By adding the option `BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes" CL=<name of CI method>)`, the other CIs are output as shown below. You can list any number of the available methods within the BINOMIAL option CL=XXXX separated by a space. However, SAS will only calculate the WILSON and WALD or the WILSON(CORRECT) and WALD(CORRECT). SAS wont output them both from the same procedure.

-   `BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes" CL=CLOPPERPEARSON WALD WILSON AGRESTICOULL JEFFREYS MIDP LIKELIHOODRATIO LOGIT BLAKER)` will return Agresti-Coull, BLAKER, Clopper-pearson(Exact), WALD(without continuity correction) WILSON(without continuity correction), JEFFREYS, MIDP, LIKELIHOODRATIO, and LOGIT

-   `BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes" CL=ALL);` will return Agresti-Coull, Clopper-pearson (Exact), Jeffreys, Wald(without continuity correction), Wilson (without continuity correction)

-   `BINOMIALc(LEVEL="Yes" CL=ALL);`will return Agresti-Coull, Clopper-pearson (Exact), Jeffreys, Wald (with continuity correction), Wilson(with continuity correction)

-   `BINOMIALc(LEVEL="Yes" CL=WILSON(CORRECT)  WALD(CORRECT));`will return Wilson(with continuity correction) and Wald (with continuity correction)

```{R}
#| eval: false

proc freq data=adcibc;
         table resp/ nopct nocol 
                     BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes" 
                              CL= CLOPPERPEARSON WALD WILSON 
                                  AGRESTICOULL JEFFREYS MIDP 
                                  LIKELIHOODRATIO LOGIT BLAKER);
  by trt; 
run;

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%", fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/ci_for_prop/binomial_prop_all_act.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../images/ci_for_prop/binomial_prop_all_pbo.png")
```

```{R}
#| eval: false

proc freq data=adcibc;
         table resp/ nopct nocol 
                     BINOMIAL(LEVEL="Yes" 
                              CL= WILSON(CORRECT)  WALD(CORRECT));
  by trt; 
run;

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%", fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/ci_for_prop/binomial_prop_cc_act.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../images/ci_for_prop/binomial_prop_cc_pbo.png")
```

SAS output often rounds to 3 or 4 decimal places in the output window, however the full values can be obtained using SAS ODS statements. `ods output binomialcls=bcl;` and then using the bcl dataset, in a data step to put the variable out to the number of decimal places we require.\
10 decimal places shown here ! `lowercl2=put(lowercl,12.10);`
