### Performing McNemar's test in SAS

To demonstrate McNemar's test in SAS, data concerning the presence or absence of cold symptoms was used. The symptoms were recorded by the same children at the age of 12 and 14. A total of 2638 participants were involved.

#### Using PROC FREQ

Testing for a significant difference in cold symptoms between ages, using McNemar's test in SAS, can be performed as below. The AGREE option is stated within the FREQ procedure to produce agreement tests and measures, including McNemar's test.

```{r}
#| eval: false
proc freq data=colds;
  tables age12*age14 / agree;
run;
```

#### Results

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 40%
knitr::include_graphics("../images/mcnemar/sas-mcnemar.png")
```

SAS outputs the tabulated data for proportions, the McNemar's Chi-square statistic, and the Kappa coefficient with 95% confidence limits. There is no continuity correction used and no option to include this.
