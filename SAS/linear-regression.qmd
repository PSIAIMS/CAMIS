To demonstrate the use of linear regression we examine a dataset that illustrates the relationship between Height and Weight in a group of 237 teen-aged boys and girls. The dataset is available at (../data/htwt.csv) and is imported to sas using proc import procedure.

### Descriptive Statistics

The first step is to obtain the simple descriptive statistics for the numeric variables of htwt data, and one-way frequencies for categorical variables. This is accomplished by employing proc means and proc freq procedures There are 237 participants who are from 13.9 to 25 years old. It is a cross-sectional study, with each participant having one observation. We can use this data set to examine the relationship of participants' height to their age and sex.

```{sas}
#| eval: false
proc means data=htwt;
run;
```

```

In order to create a regression model to demonstrate the relationship between age and height for females, we first need to create a flag variable identifying females and an interaction variable between age and female gender flag.

```{sas}
#| eval: false
data htwt2;
  set htwt;
  if sex="f" then female=1;
  if sex="m" then female=0; 

  *model to demonstrate interaction between female gender and age;
  fem_age = female * age;  
run;
```

### Regression Analysis

Next, we fit a regression model, representing the relationships between gender, age, height and the interaction variable created in the datastep above. We again use a where statement to restrict the analysis to those who are less than or equal to 19 years old. We use the clb option to get a 95% confidence interval for each of the parameters in the model. The model that we are fitting is ***height = b0 + b1 x female + b2 x age + b3 x fem_age + e***

```{sas}
#| eval: false
proc reg data=htwt2;
    where age <=19;
    model height = female age fem_age / clb;
run; 
quit;
```

We examine the parameter estimates in the output below.

```

From the parameter estimates table the coefficients b0,b1,b2,b3 are estimated as b0=28.88 b1=13.61 b2=2.03 b3=-0.92942

The resulting regression model for height, age and gender based on the available data is ***height=28.88281 + 13.61231 x female + 2.03130 x age -0.92943 x fem_age***
