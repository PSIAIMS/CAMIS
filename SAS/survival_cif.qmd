title: "Estimating Cumulative Incidence Functions Using SAS"
---

## Objective

In this document we present how to estimate the cumulative incidence function (CIF) in SAS (version 9.4). We focus on the competing risks model where each subject experiences only one out of *k* possible events as depicted in the figure below.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 25%
knitr::include_graphics("../images/survival_competing_risks/cr.jpg")
```

### Data used

The bone marrow transplant (BTM) dataset as presented by Guo & So (2018) is used. The dataset has the following variables:

-   `Group` has three levels, indicating three disease groups: ALL, AML-Low Risk, AML-High Risk.

-   `T` is the disease-free survival time in days. A derived variable `TYears = T/365.25` is used in the analysis.

-   `Status` has value 0 if `T` is censored; 1 if `T` is time to relapse; 2 if `T` is time to death.

-   `WaitTime` is the waiting time to transplant in days. This variable is not used here.

-   A new variable `ID` is created.

SAS code to prepare the data:

```{r}
#| eval: false
proc format;
  value DiseaseGroup 1='ALL'
                     2='AML-Low Risk'
                     3='AML-High Risk';
  value EventStatus  0='Censored'
                     1='Relapse'
                     2='Death';
run;
libname datalib "..\data";
data bmt;
  set datalib.bmt;
  TYears = T / 365.25;
  ID = _n_;
  format Group DiseaseGroup.;
  format Status EventStatus.;
run;
```

## Estimating CIFs in SAS

PROC LIFETEST is used to estimate the CIFs in SAS. For illustration, we model the time to relapse.  
```{r}
#| eval: false
ods graphics on;
proc lifetest data=bmt 
              plots=cif(test) 
              error=aalen
              conftype=loglog
              outcif=cif1 
              timelist=0.5 1 1.5 2 3; 
  time Tyears * Status(0) / eventcode=1; 
  strata Group / order=internal; 
  format Group DiseaseGroup.;
run; 
ods graphics off;
```

Below are selected outputs for comparison with the R outputs in the companion document.

CIF estimates for time to relapse at selected timepoints for 'AML-Low Risk' patients:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 75%
knitr::include_graphics("../images/survival_competing_risks/cifSAS.jpg")
```

CIF estimates for time to relapses:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 75%
knitr::include_graphics("../images/survival_competing_risks/cifPlot.png")
```

Two points to note:

1.  By default the variance of the estimated CIF are estimated with Aalen's asymptotic method. This can be changed to the delta method by setting `error=delta` in the PROC LIFETEST statement.

2.  By default the log-log transformation is used to produce the pointwise confidence intervals (CIs) for the estimated CIFs. To select other methods, for instance log, set `conftype=log`.
