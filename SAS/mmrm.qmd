# Mixed Models

#### Fitting the MMRM in SAS

In SAS the following code was used (assessments at `avisitn=0` should also be removed from the response variable):

```{sas}
#| eval: false
proc mixed data=adlbh;
    where base ne . and avisitn not in (., 99);
    class usubjid trtpn(ref="0") avisitn;
    by paramcd param;
    model chg=base trtpn avisitn  trtpn*avisitn / solution cl alpha=0.05 ddfm=KR;
    repeated avisitn/subject=usubjid type=&covar;
    lsmeans trtpn * avisitn / diff cl slice=avisitn;
    lsmeans trtpn / diff cl;
run;
```

where the macro variable `covar` could be `UN`, `CS` or `AR(1)`. The results were stored in .csv files that were post-processed in R and compared with the results from R.
