title: "Calculating Quantiles (percentiles) in SAS"
---

Percentiles can be calculated in SAS using the UNIVARIATE procedure. The procedure has the option `PCTLDEF` which allows for five different percentile definitions to be used. The default is `PCTLDEF=5`, which uses the empirical distribution function to find percentiles.

This is how the 25th and 40th percentiles of `aval` in the dataset `adlb` could be calculated, using the default option for `PCTLDEF`.
For quantiles, Q1= 25%, Q2=50%, Q3 = 75%, Q4=100%.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
proc univariate data=adlb;
  var aval;
  output out=stats pctlpts=25 40 pctlpre=p;
run;
```

The `pctlpre=p` option tells SAS the prefix to use in the output dataset for the percentile results. In the above example, SAS will create a dataset called `stats`, containing variables `p25` and `p40`.
