# **ANCOVA in SAS**

In SAS, there are several ways to perform ANCOVA analysis. One common way is to use PROC GLM with the LSMEANS option. The below example will use this method.

### Data Used

The following data was used in this example.

```{sas}
#| eval: false
data DrugTest;
    input Drug $ PreTreatment PostTreatment @@;
    datalines;
  A 11  6   A  8  0   A  5  2   A 14  8   A 19 11
  A  6  4   A 10 13   A  6  1   A 11  8   A  3  0
  D  6  0   D  6  2   D  7  3   D  8  1   D 18 18
  D  8  4   D 19 14   D  8  9   D  5  1   D 15  9
  F 16 13   F 13 10   F 11 18   F  9  5   F 21 23
  F 16 12   F 12  5   F 12 16   F  7  1   F 12 20
  ;
  proc print;
  run;
```

### Code

The following code was used to test the effects of a drug pre and post treatment:

```{sas}
#| eval: false
proc glm data=DrugTest;
    class Drug;
    model PostTreatment = Drug PreTreatment / solution;
    lsmeans Drug / stderr pdiff cov out=adjmeans;
run;
proc print data=adjmeans;
run;
```

Output:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
knitr::include_graphics("../images/ancova/sas_ancova0.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../images/ancova/sas_ancova1.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../images/ancova/sas_ancova2.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../images/ancova/sas_ancova3.png")
```

As can be seen in the images above, the GLM procedure provides multiple types of analysis to determine the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The last step produces a table of LSMEANS and coefficient of variation values for each of the three different drugs in the dataset.
