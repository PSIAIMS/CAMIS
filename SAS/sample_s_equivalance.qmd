PROC POWER^2^ is used for sample size calculations for equivalence testing^1^. It can calculate

-   one sample test of mean (i.e. 1 treatment mean is equivalent to a target value)

-   two-sample comparison of means (i.e. 2 treatment means recorded on 2 independent groups of patients are equivalent within a set tolerance)

-   Paired-sample comparison of means (i.e. 2 treatment means recorded on 1 group of patients are equivalent within a set tolerance)

-   One sample test of proportion (i.e. 1 treatment proportion is equivalent to a target value)

-   **However, PROC POWER CANNOT calculate sample size for two-sample comparisons of proportions** (i.e. 2 treatment proportions recorded on 2 independent groups of patients are equivalent within a set tolerance)

### **One-sample equivalence test**

Suppose a reformulation of a treatment pill, needs to have a weight equivalent to a target value of 130 milligrams. Weight is assumed normally distributed and an acceptable weight is between 110 milligrams and 150 milligrams. The standard deviation of the weight is 50 milligrams. What sample size is needed assuming an alpha level of 5% with 80% power to conclude the weight is within the margin (the tablet weight is equivalent to 130 milligram).
The below shows a sample size of 55 pills is required.

```{r eval=FALSE}
PROC POWER  ;
   onesamplemeans test=equiv   
   lower  = 110          
   upper  = 150         
   mean   = 130     
   stddev = 50      
   ntotal = .       
   power  = 0.8      
   alpha  = 0.05;    
RUN;
```         
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/sample_s_equivalence/SAS1mean.png")
```

### **Comparing means for parallel design (unpaired)**

Next lets look at having 2 independent samples. In the most common scenario SDs are assumed known and the same in both treatment groups. 

#### Example 1: Sample size for comparison of 2 independant treatment group means with same known SDs

It is anticipated that patients will have the same mean diastolic BP of 96 mmHg on both the new drug and the active comparator. It is also anticipated that the SD (ơ) of the diastolic BP is approximately 8 mmHg. The decision is made by clinical to accept equivalence if the difference found between the treatments is less than 5 mmHg. How many patients are required for an 80% power and an overall significance level of 5%?

The below shows a sample size of 45 patients per treatment group is required (90 patients in total).

```{r eval=FALSE}
PROC POWER  ;
   twosamplemeans test=equiv_diff   
   lower  = 91          
   upper  = 101   
   meandiff=96 
   stddev = 8      
   ntotal = .       
   power  = 0.8      
   alpha  = 0.05;    
RUN;
```

As shown below, a total sample size of 90 is recommended, which equates to 45 in each group.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/sample_s_equivalence/SAS2mean_independant.png")
```


#### Example 2: Sample size for comparison of 2 independant treatment group mean ratios with same known SDs

A client is interested in conducting a clinical trial to compare two cholesterol lowering agents for treatment of hypercholesterolemic patients through a parallel design.  The primary efficacy parameter is a low-density lipidprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). For establishing equivalence, suppose the true mean difference is 0.01 (1%) and the equivalence limit is 0.05 (5%). Assuming SD = 0.01, how many patients are required for an 80% power and an overall significance level of 5%?

The below shows a sample size of 2 patients per treatment group is required (4 patients in total).

```{r eval=FALSE}
PROC POWER  ;
   twosamplemeans test=equiv_diff  
   lower  = -0.04         
   upper  = 0.06  
   meandiff=0.01 
   stddev=0.01     
   ntotal = .       
   power  = 0.8      
   alpha  = 0.05;    
RUN;
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/sample_s_equivalence/SAS2.png")
```



### **Comparing means for crossover design (paired)**

It is important to differentiate here between the within patient SD and the SD of the difference. We may need to recalculate one to the other, depending on the case.

Variance of the difference = 2x Variance within patient. Vardiff=2∗Varpatient

#### Example

Let’s consider a standard standard two-sequence, two period crossover design for trials to establish therapeutic equivalence between a test drug and a standard therapy. The sponsor is interested in heaving an 80% power for establishing equivalence. Based on the results from previous trials, it is estimated that the variance (of the difference) is 0.02 (20%). Suppose that the  true mean difference is -0.01 (-10%) and the equivalence limit is 0.25 (25%). What is the required sample size, assuming significance level of 5%?

NOTE: It is important to differentiate here between the within patient SD and the SD of the difference. We may need to recalculate one to the other, depending on the case.

Variance of the difference = 2x Variance within patient. Vardiff=2∗Varpatient

In SAS, we also have to assume the correlation between each pair of measurements on the same subject. Here we assume this is 0.5 correlation.

The below shows a sample size of 8 patients is required.

```{r eval=FALSE}
PROC POWER;
   pairedmeans test=equiv_diff   
   lower  = -35          
   upper  = 15   
   meandiff=-10 
   stddev = 20      
   npairs = .  
   corr=0.5
   power  = 0.8      
   alpha  = 0.05; 
RUN;
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/sample_s_equivalence/SAS2crossovermeans.png")

```
