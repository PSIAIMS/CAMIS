# Introduction

PROC POWER^1^ can be used for sample size calculations for non-inferiority testing. See ^2^ for explanation of non-inferiority and how to perform Sample size in SAS (including comparing proportions). Below we give 2 sample size examples for the following types of studies:

-   two-sample comparison of means for Non-inferiority (i.e. testing if one treatment mean is non-inferior to the another treatment mean).

-   Paired-sample comparison of means (i.e. 2 treatment means recorded on 1 group of patients are equivalent within a set tolerance)

# **Two Sample Non-inferiority test: Comparing means for parallel design (unpaired)**

This example is a sample size calculation for the following hypotheses: $H_0:\mu2-\mu1\le -\theta$ versus $H_1: \mu2-\mu1\gt -\theta$.

A client is interested in conducting a clinical trial to compare two cholesterol lowering agents for treatment of hypercholesterolemic patients through a parallel design. The primary efficacy parameter is a low-density lipidprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We will consider the situation where the intended trial is for testing noninferiority. For establishing it, suppose the true mean difference is 0 and the noninferiority margin is chosen to be -0.05 (-5%). Assuming SD = 0.1, how many patients are required for an 80% power and an overall significance level of 5%?

```{r}
#| eval: false
PROC POWER  ;    
  twosamplemeans 
  test=equiv_diff      
  lower  = 91
  upper  = 101  
  meandiff=96 
  stddev = 8
  ntotal = .  
  power  = 0.8
  alpha  = 0.05;
  RUN;
```

As shown below, a total sample size of 102 is recommended, which equates to 51 in each group.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
knitr::include_graphics("../images/sample_s_noninferiority/2_sample_parallelgroup_means.png")
```

# **Comparing means for crossover design (paired)**

Here we assume there is no carry-over effect and that the variance is known. For more information see^3^. There is no obvious way in SAS to do cross over non-inferiority, however, given the one sided test, you can half the alpha using the equiv_diff option to give you the non-inferiority sample size.

## **Estimating the within patient variance and correlation.**

Let's consider a standard two-sequence, two period crossover design. Suppose that the sponsor is interested in showing non-inferiority of the test drug against the reference with the non-inferiority margin -20%. Assume power of 80%. Based on the results from previous trials, it is estimated that the variance (of the difference) is 0.2 (20%). Suppose that the true mean difference is -0.1 (-10%). What is the required sample size, assuming significance level of 5%?

Alpha = 0.025 is used below, instead of 0.05 because you are doing non-inferiority (a one sided test). Note that this is still the sample size for alpha=0.05. The below shows a sample size of 13 patients is required.

```{r}
#| eval: false
   pairedmeans 
   test=equiv_diff
      lower=-0.3
      upper=0.1
      meandiff   = -0.1
      stddev=0.2
      corr          = 0.5
      alpha         = 0.025
      npairs        = .
      power         = 0.8;
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
knitr::include_graphics("../images/sample_s_noninferiority/2_sample_crossover_means.png")
```
