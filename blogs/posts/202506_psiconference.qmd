The PSI Conference 2025 took place 8th-11th June 2025 in Wembley, London.

The CAMIS team in collaboration with the [PSI AIMS SIG](https://psiaims.github.io/website/) presented 2 talks at the conference. PHUSE kindly supported the team with provision of PHUSE CAMIS t-shirts and stickers to hand out, which contained the QR code for the repo. This really helped us to stand out among the 400+ statisticians and to spread the word about the CAMIS project repository.

The first of the talks entitled: "R you (all) right, SAS? Replicating statistical results between software", contained an introduction to the CAMIS project presented by Lyn Taylor, followed by a case study example on how to compare methods across software and in particular methods to assess which r packages to use, presented by Christina Fillmore. Slides can be found here: [CAMIS](../../non_website_content/conferences/2025/202506_PSI_Christina_Lyn.pptx)

In the second talk entitled: (Sample) size matters - demonstrating sample size calculations across software, Agnieszka Tomczyk presented findings from replicating sample size methods in SAS, StatXact, EAST and R. Slides can be found here: [Samplesize](../../non_website_content/conferences/2025/202506_PSI_Agnieszka_Tomczyk.pptx)

We received really positive feedback from the industry on our CAMIS repository, with everyone agreeing it will help to eliminate duplication of researching the methodology differences between software.
