title: "Introduction Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software (CAMIS)"
---

Are you trying to replicate results using different software/languages and struggling to find out why you can't match the results? Check out the [CAMIS repository](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS)!

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/logo.png") 
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/qrcode_website.png")   
```

The CAMIS repository stores documentation detailing the reasons for observed differences when performing statistical analysis in SAS and R. The repository is housed on github, and will be populated through open-source community contributions.

Differences between software could be due to different default and available options, including the methods being used. By documenting these known differences in a repository, we aim to reduce time-consuming efforts within the community, where multiple people are investigating the same issues. If you find an issue not already investigated, please log an Issue in github. If you have time to investigate and document the reason for the issue, then please submit a pull request with the new content in a quarto file. Details of how to contribute can be found on the website.

CAMIS is a PHUSE working group in collaboration with PSI and the R consortium. Initially the repository contains R and SAS analysis result comparisons, however the team hope to extend to other software/languages in the near future. Our white paper will soon be available on the website. Please help us to build a high quality and comprehensive repository.
