CAMIS (Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software) is a PHUSE DVOST working group (WG) collaboration with PSI AIMS SIG. The CAMIS open-source repository aims to provide essential information about the application of statistical methodology in various software (including SAS, R and Python). A lack of clear specification of methods can result in an inability to reproduce the same results in different software, especially as not all options are available in all software, and existing documentation can sometimes be unclear.

By documenting found differences in a repository, we aim to reduce time-consuming efforts within the community, where multiple people are investigating the same issues. Please help us in 2026 and beyond to build a high quality, easy-to-read and comprehensive repository. With your support, the repository will continue to grow in content and be a vital source for medical statisticians and programmers.
