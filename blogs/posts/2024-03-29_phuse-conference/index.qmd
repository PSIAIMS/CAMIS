Congratulations, [Soma Sekhar Sriadibhatla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soma-sekhar-s-20381416a/), on your poster presentation "CAMIS-An open source repository to document differences in statistical methodology software" at PHUSE US Connect 2024.

A poster was presented on PHUSE DVOST-CAMIS effort to document discrepancies between programming languages such as SAS, R, and Python (due to software default choices) in order to conduct the same end-point analysis, a cheat sheet across multilingual languages, and the CAMIS-ONCO subgroup.

We are pleased to inform you that we have received positive feedback from the industry on our CAMIS repository, which helps them to eliminate the risk of doing end point analysis in a multilingual world.
